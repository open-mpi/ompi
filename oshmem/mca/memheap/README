MEMHEAP Infrustructure documentation
------------------------------------

MEMHEAP Infrustructure is responsible for managing the symmetric heap.
The framework currently has following components: buddy and ptmalloc. buddy which uses a buddy allocator in order to manage the Memory allocations on the symmetric heap. Ptmalloc is an adaptation of ptmalloc3. 

Additional components may be added easily to the framework by defining the component's and the module's base and extended structures, and their funtionalities.

The buddy allocator has the following data structures: 
1. Base component - of type struct mca_memheap_base_component_2_0_0_t
2. Base module - of type struct mca_memheap_base_module_t 
3. Buddy component - of type struct mca_memheap_base_component_2_0_0_t
4. Buddy module - of type struct mca_memheap_buddy_module_t extending the base module (struct mca_memheap_base_module_t)

Each data structure includes the following fields:
1. Base component - memheap_version, memheap_data and memheap_init
2. Base module - Holds pointers to the base component and to the functions: alloc, free and finalize
3. Buddy component - is a base component.
4. Buddy module - Extends the base module and holds additional data on the components's priority, buddy allocator, 
   maximal order of the symmetric heap, symmetric heap, pointer to the symmetric heap and hashtable maintaining the size of each allocated address.

In the case that the user decides to implement additional components, the Memheap infrastructure chooses a component with the maximal priority.
Handling the component opening is done under the base directory, in three stages: 
1. Open all available components. Implemented by memheap_base_open.c and called from shmem_init. 
2. Select the maximal priority component. This procedure involves the initialization of all components and then their
   finalization except to the chosen component. It is implemented by memheap_base_select.c and called from shmem_init.
3. Close the max priority active cmponent. Implemented by memheap_base_close.c and called from shmem finalize. 

 
Buddy Component/Module
----------------------

Responsible for handling the entire activities of the symmetric heap.
The supported activities are: 
                            - buddy_init (Initialization) 
                            - buddy_alloc (Allocates a variable on the symmetric heap)
                            - buddy_free (frees a variable previously allocated on the symetric heap)
                            - buddy_finalize (Finalization).
 
Data members of buddy module: - priority. The module's priority.
                              - buddy allocator: bits, num_free, lock and the maximal order (log2 of the maximal size) 
                                of a variable on the symmetric heap. Buddy Allocator gives the offset in the symmetric heap
                                where a variable should be allocated. 
                              - symmetric_heap: a range of reserved addresses (equal in all executing PE's) dedicated to "shared memory" allocation.
                              - symmetric_heap_hashtable (holding the size of an allocated variable on the symmetric heap.
                                 used to free an allocated variable on the symmetric heap)
