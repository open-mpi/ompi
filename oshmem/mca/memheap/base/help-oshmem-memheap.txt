[find-available:none-found]
No available %s components were found!

This means that there are no components of this type installed on your
system or all the components reported that they could not be used.

This is a fatal error; your SHMEM process is likely to abort.  Check the
output of the "ompi_info" command and ensure that components of this
type are available on your system.  You may also wish to check the
value of the "component_path" MCA parameter and ensure that it has at
least one directory that contains valid MCA components.
