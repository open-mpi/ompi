[sysv:create segment failure]

You can try the following:

1. Use a different sshmem plugin (e.g., "mmap") with "--mca sshmem mmap".
2. Decrease the symmetric heap area size with "-x
   SHMEM_SYMMETRIC_HEAP_SIZE=<value>".
3. Increase your system's allowable SYSV shared memory segment size
   (e.g., via the SHMMAX and/or SMMAX kernel parameters).
4. Set "--mca sshmem_base_start_address 0" for
   automatic selection by OS of virtual start address for sshmem.
