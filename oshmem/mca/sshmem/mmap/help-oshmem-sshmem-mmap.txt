[mmap:create segment failure]

You can try the following:

1. Decrease the symmetric heap area with
   "-x SHMEM_SYMMETRIC_HEAP_SIZE=<value>".
2. Set "--mca sshmem_base_start_address 0" for
   automatic selection by OS of virtual start address for sshmem.

This issue could also be related to CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM
kernel option which if enabled prevents access to physical
memory via "mmap". In this case you could try using other
sshmem components instead.
