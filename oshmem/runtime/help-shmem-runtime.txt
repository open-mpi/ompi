[shmem_init:startup:internal-failure]
It looks like %s failed for some reason; your parallel process is
likely to abort.  There are many reasons that a parallel process can
fail during %s; some of which are due to configuration or environment
problems.  This failure appears to be an internal failure; here's some
additional information (which may only be relevant to an Open SHMEM
developer):

  %s
  --> Returned "%s" (%d) instead of "Success" (0)
#
[heterogeneous-support-unavailable]
This installation of Open SHMEM was configured without support for
heterogeneous architectures, but at least one node in the allocation
was detected to have a different architecture. The detected node was:

Node: %s

In order to operate in a heterogeneous environment, please reconfigure
Open SHMEM with --enable-heterogeneous.
#
[oshmem shmem abort:cannot guarantee all killed]
A SHMEM process is aborting at a time when it cannot guarantee that all
of its peer processes in the job will be killed properly.  You should
double check that everything has shut down cleanly.

Local host: %s
PID:        %d
