#
# Input file for script ompi_branch_check_revisions.sh
# here for the v1.5 branch
#
# Contains optional notes for revisions, about:
#  1. reasons, why this revision ought not to be merged
#  2. dependencies on other revisions (if any known)
#  3. existing CMRs
#
# Yes this file is optional, also revisions, that do not show
# up in `svn mergeinfo --svn eligible` are not required
# here (but don't hurt either).
