Running the Launch-Scaling Test Script

This script will execute a series of very fast tests to measure
relative timing behavior, including the time required to simply
launch an application, and the time required to launch and wireup
an MPI job. The latter will be tested both using the traditional full
synchronous modex, and using the new "instant on" methodology.

Tests will be conducted at all powers-of-two intervals up to the
fully available allocation. The script will automatically detect
the availability of direct launch tools such as "srun" and "aprun",
and will include those in the tests. You may select the specific
starting tools to be included via the cmd line options.

If you are willing to share the results of the tests, please save
them in a CSV file (using the --results=<file> option) and email
the file to either:

* the PMIx mailing list: pmix@googlegropups.com, or
* the OMPI developers mailing list: devel@open-mpi.org

Please include info on the out-of-band network on your system - e.g.,
1Gb Ethernet, IPoIB, or IP-over-Gemini. This will greatly assist us
in improving the launch performance of Open MPI.

Thank you!
