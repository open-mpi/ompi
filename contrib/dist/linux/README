===========================================================================

Note that you probably want to download the latest release of the SRPM
for any given Open MPI version.  The SRPM release number is the
version after the dash in the SRPM filename.  For example,
"openmpi-1.6.3-2.src.rpm" is the 2nd release of the SRPM for Open MPI
v1.6.3.  Subsequent releases of SRPMs typically contain bug fixes for
the RPM packaging, but not Open MPI itself.

The buildrpm.sh script takes a single argument -- a filename pointing
to an Open MPI tarball (may be either .gz or .bz2).  It will create
one or more RPMs from this tarball:

1. Source RPM
2. "All in one" RPM, where all of Open MPI is put into a single RPM.
3. "Multiple" RPM, where Open MPI is split into several sub-package
   RPMs:
   - openmpi-runtime
   - openmpi-devel
   - openmpi-docs

The prefix, target architecture, and choice of RPM(s) to build are all
currently hard-coded in the beginning of the buildrpm.sh script.

Alternatively, you can build directly from the openmpi.spec spec file
or SRPM directly.  Many options can be passed to the building process
via rpmbuild's --define option (there are older versions of rpmbuild
that do not seem to handle --define'd values properly in all cases,
but we generally don't care about those old versions of rpmbuild...).
The available options are described in the comments in the beginning
of the spec file in this directory.
