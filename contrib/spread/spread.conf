# Spread options
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Set what internal Spread events are logged to the screen or file 
# (see EventLogFile).
# Default setting is to enable PRINT and EXIT events only. 
#The PRINT and EXIT types should always be enabled. The names of others are:
#    	EXIT PRINT DEBUG DATA_LINK NETWORK PROTOCOL SESSION 
#	CONFIGURATION MEMBERSHIP FLOW_CONTROL STATUS EVENTS 
#	GROUPS MEMORY SKIPLIST ALL NONE	
#    ALL and NONE are special and represent either enabling every type 
#                                           or enabling none of them.
#    You can also use a "!" sign to negate a type, 
#        so { ALL !DATA_LINK } means log all events except data_link ones.

#DebugFlags = { PRINT EXIT }
DebugFlags = { ALL }

# Set priority level of events to output to log file or screen
# The possible levels are: 
#	pDEBUG INFO WARNING ERROR CRITICAL FATAL
# Once selected all events tagged with that priority or higher will
# be output. FATAL events are always output and cause the daemon to 
# shut down. Some Events are tagged with a priority of PRINT which
# causes them to print out no matter what priority level is set. 
#
# The default level used if nothing is set is INFO.
	
#EventPriority =  INFO

#Set whether to log to a file as opposed to stdout/stderr and what 
# file to log to.
# Default is to log to stdout.
#
#If option is not set then logging is to stdout.
#If option is set then logging is to the filename specified.
# The filename can include a %h or %H escape that will be replaced at runtime
# by the hostname of the machine upon which the daemon is running.
# For example "EventLogFile = spreadlog_%h.log" with 2 machines 
# running Spread (machine1.mydomain.com and machine2.mydomain.com) will
# cause the daemons to log to "spreadlog_machine1.mydomain.com.log" and
# "spreadlog_machine2.mydomain.com.log" respectively.

#EventLogFile = testlog.out
EventLogFile = spread_%h.log

#Set whether to add a timestamp in front of all logged events or not.
# Default is no timestamps. Default format is "[%a %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S]".
#If option is commented out then no timestamp is added.
#If option is enabled then a timestamp is added with the default format
#If option is enabled and set equal to a string, then that string is used
#   as the format string for the timestamp. The string must be a valid time
#   format string as used by the strftime() function.

#EventTimeStamp
# or
#EventTimeStamp = "[%a %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S]"
EventTimeStamp = "[%a %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S]"

#Set whether to add a precise (microsecond) resolution timestamp to all logged
# events or not. This option requires that EventTimeStamp is also enabled. 
# If the option is commented out then the microsecond timestamp is not added
# If the option is uncommented then a microsecond time will print in addition
#  to the H:M:S resolution timestamp provided by EventTimeStamp. 

#EventPreciseTimeStamp

# Set to initialize daemon sequence numbers to a 'large' number for testing
# this is purely a debugging capability and should never be enabled on
# production systems (note one side effect of enabling this is that 
# your system will experience an extra daemon membership every few messages
# so you REALLY do not want this turned on)
# If you want to change the initial value the sequence number is set to
# you need to edit the #define INITIAL_SEQUENCE_NEAR_WRAP at the top
# of configuration.h

#DebugInitialSequence

#Set whether to allow dangerous monitor commands 
# like "partition, flow_control, or kill"
# Default setting is FALSE.
#If option is set to false then only "safe" monitor commands are allowed 
#    (such as requesting a status update).
#If option is set to true then all monitor commands are enabled. 
#   THIS IS A SECURTIY RISK IF YOUR NETWORK IS NOT PROTECTED!

#DangerousMonitor = false
DangerousMonitor = true

#Set handling of SO_REUSEADDR socket option for the daemon's TCP
# listener.  This is useful for facilitating quick daemon restarts (OSes
# often hold onto the interface/port combination for a short period of time
# after daemon shut down).
#
# AUTO - Active when bound to specific interfaces (default).
# ON   - Always active, regardless of interface.
#        SECURITY RISK FOR ANY OS WHICH ALLOW DOUBLE BINDS BY DIFFERENT USERS
# OFF  - Always off.

#SocketPortReuse = AUTO

#Set what the maximum per-session queue should be for messages before disconnecting
# a session. Spread will buffer upto that number of messages that are destined to the 
# session, but that can not be delivered currently because the session is not reading fast enough. 
# The compiled in default is usually 1000 if you havn't changed it in the spread_params.h file. 

#MaxSessionMessages = 5000
MaxSessionMessages = 5000

#Sets the runtime directory used when the Spread daemon is run as root
# as the directory to chroot to.  Defaults to the value of the
# compile-time preprocessor define SP_RUNTIME_DIR, which is generally
# "/var/run/spread".

#RuntimeDir = /var/run/spread

#Sets the unix user that the Spread daemon runs as (when launched as
# the "root" user).  Not effective on a Windows system.  Defaults to
# the user and group "spread".

#DaemonUser = spread
#DaemonGroup = spread


#Set the list of authentication methods that the daemon will allow
# and those which are required in all cases.
# All of the methods listed in "RequiredAuthMethods" will be checked,
# irregardless of what methods the client chooses.
# Of the methods listed is "AllowedAuthMethods" the client is
# permitted to choose one or more, and all the ones the client chooses
# will also be checked.
#
# To support older clients, if NULL is enabled, then older clients can
# connect without any authentication. Any methods which do not require
# any interaction with the client (such as IP) can also be enabled
# for older clients. If you enable methods that require interaction,
# then essentially all older clients will be locked out.
#
#The current choices are:
#	NULL for default, allow anyone authentication
#	IP for IP based checks using the spread.access_ip file

#RequiredAuthMethods = "   "
#AllowedAuthMethods = "NULL"

#Set the current access control policy.
# This is only needed if you want to establish a customized policy.
# The default policy is to allow any actions by authenticated clients.
#AccessControlPolicy = "PERMIT"

# Spread will feel free to use broadcast messages within a sub-network.
# if you do not want this to happen, you should specify your machines on
# different logical sub-networks.

# IP-Multicast addresses can also be used as the multicast address for
# the logical sub-network as in this example. If IP-multicast is supported
# by the operating system, then the messages will only be received
# by those machines who are in the group and not by all others in the same
# sub-network as happens with broadcast addresses

# Multi-homed host setup
#
# If you run Spread on hosts with multiple interfaces you may want to 
# control which interfaces Spread uses for client connections and for
# the daemon-to-daemon (and monitor control) messages. This can be done
# by adding an extra stanza to each configured machine. 
#
#Sample:
#
#Spread_Segment 225.0.1.1 {
# 	multihomed1		1.2.3.4 {
#		D 192.168.0.4
#		C 1.2.3.4 }
#	multihomed2		1.2.3.5 {
#		D 192.168.0.5
#		C 1.2.3.5
#		C 127.0.0.1 }
#	multihomed3		1.2.3.6 {
#		192.168.0.6
#		1.2.3.6 }
#}
# This configuration sets up three multihomed machines into a Spread segment.
# The first host has a 'main' IP address of 1.2.3.4 and listens for client
# connections only on that interface. All daemon-to-daemon UDP multicasts and
# the tokens and any monitor messages must use the 192.168.0.4 interface.
# The second host multihomed2 has a similar setup, except it also listens for
# client connections on the localhost interface as well as the 1.2.3.5 interface.
# If you make any use of the extra interface stanza ( a { } block ) then you must
# explicitly configure ALL interfaces you want as Spread removes all defaults when
# you use the explicit notation.
# The third multihomed3 host uses a shorthand form of omitting the D or C option and
# just listening for all types of traffic and events on both the 192.168.0 and 1.2.3 
# networks. If no letter is listed before the interface address then ALL types of 
# events are handled on that interface.
