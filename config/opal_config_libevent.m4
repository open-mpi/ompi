dnl Check for / configure libevent package.  Prefer finding an
dnl external libevent, build our internal one if required.  If we can
dnl not find an external libevent and the internal one fails to
dnl configure, abort.
dnl
dnl This macro will change the environment in the following way:
dnl
dnl   * opal_libevent_header [legacy] - will be set if building
dnl         internally, to the header file that should be included for
dnl         embedded builds.  This is used by PRRTE, but should not
dnl         be used by new code.
dnl   * opal_libevent_mode - either external or internal.  If internal,
dnl         --with-libevent should be ignored by other packages
dnl   * opal_libevent_CPPFLAGS - the C Preprocessor flags necessary to
dnl         run the preprocessor on a file which relies on Libevent
dnl         headers.  This will be folded into the global CPPFLAGS,
dnl         so most people should never need this.
dnl   * opal_libevent_LDFLAGS - the linker flags necessary to run the
dnl         linker on a file which relies on Libevent libraries.  This
dnl         will be folded into the global CPPFLAGS, so most people
dnl         should never need this.
dnl   * opal_libevent_LIBS - the libraries necessary to link source which
dnl         uses Libevent.  Cannot be added to LIBS yet, because then
dnl         other execution tests later in configure (there are sadly
dnl         some) would fail if the path in LDFLAGS was not added to
dnl         LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
dnl   * opal_libevent_WRAPPER_LDFLAGS - the linker flags necessary to
dnl         add to the wrapper compilers in order to link an opal
dnl         application when opal is built as a static library.
dnl   * opal_libevent_WRAPPER_LIBS - the linker flags necessary to
dnl         add to the wrapper compilers in order to link an opal
dnl         application when opal is built as a static library.
dnl   * CPPFLAGS, LDFLAGS - Updated opal_libevent_CPPFLAGS and
dnl         opal_libevent_LDFLAGS.
