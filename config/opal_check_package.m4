dnl Check for package defined by header and libs, and probably
dnl located in dir-prefix, possibly with libs in libdir-prefix.
dnl Both dir-prefix and libdir-prefix can be empty.  Will set
dnl prefix_{CPPFLAGS, LDFLAGS, LIBS} as needed.
dnl
dnl The general intent of this macro is to provide finer-grained scoping
dnl of C preprocessor flags, linker flags, and libraries (as opposed to
dnl unconditionally adding to the top-level CPFLAGS, LDFLAGS, and LIBS,
dnl which get used to compile/link *everything*).
dnl
dnl Here is a breakdown of the parameters:
dnl
dnl * prefix: the macro sets $prefix_CPPFLAGS, $prefix_LDFLAGS, and
dnl   $prefix_LIBS (and AC_SUBSTs all of them).  For example, if a
dnl   provider uses this macro to check for a header/library that it
dnl   needs, it might well set prefix to be its provider name.
dnl * header_filename: the foo.h file to check for
dnl * library_name / function_name: check for function function_name in
dnl   -llibrary_name.  Specifically, for library_name, use the "foo" form,
dnl   as opposed to "libfoo".
dnl * extra_libraries: if the library_name you are checking for requires
dnl   additonal -l arguments to link successfully, list them here.
dnl * dir_prefix: if the header/library is located in a non-standard
dnl   location (e.g., /opt/foo as opposed to /usr), list it here
dnl * libdir_prefix: if the library is not under $dir_prefix/lib or
dnl   $dir_prefix/lib64, list it here.
dnl * action_if_found: if both the header and library are found and
dnl   usable, execute action_if_found
dnl * action_if_not_found: otherwise, execute action_if_not_found
dnl * extra_includes: if including header_filename requires additional
dnl   headers to be included first, list them here
dnl
dnl The output _CPPFLAGS, _LDFLAGS, and _LIBS can be used to limit the
dnl scope various flags in Makefiles.
