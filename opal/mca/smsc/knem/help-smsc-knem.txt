[knem permission denied]
WARNING: Open MPI failed to open the /dev/knem device due to a
permissions problem.  Please check with your system administrator to
get the permissions fixed, or set the smsc MCA variable to "^knem" to
silence this warning and run without knem support.

  Local host:            %s
  /dev/knem permissions: 0%o

[knem fail open]
WARNING: Open MPI failed to open the /dev/knem device due to a local
error. Please check with your system administrator to get the problem
fixed, or set the smsc MCA variable to "^knem" to silence this warning
and run without knem support.

Open MPI will try to fall back on another single-copy mechanism if one
is available.  This may result in lower performance.

[knem get ABI fail]
WARNING: Open MPI failed to retrieve the ABI version from the
/dev/knem device due to a local error.  This usually indicates an
error in your knem installation; please check with your system
administrator, or set the smsc MCA variable to "^knem" to silence this
warning and run without knem support.

Open MPI will try to fall back on another single-copy mechanism if one
is available.  This may result in lower performance.

[knem ABI mismatch]
WARNING: Open MPI was compiled with support for one version of the
knem kernel module, but it discovered a different version running in
/dev/knem. Open MPI needs to be installed with support for the same
version of knem as is in the running Linux kernel. Please check with
your system administrator, or set the smsc MCA variable to "^knem" to
silence this warning and run without knem support.

Open MPI will try to fall back on another single-copy mechanism if one
is available.  This may result in lower performance.

  Local host:              %s
  Open MPI's knem version: 0x%x
  /dev/knem's version:     0x%x
