 * Selects NIC (provider) based on hardware locality

 * The selection is based on the following priority:
 *
 * Single-NIC:
 * 
 *      If only 1 provider is available, always return that provider.
 * 
 * Multi-NIC:
 * 
 *      1. If the process is NOT bound, pick a NIC using (local rank % number
 *      of providers of the same type). This gives a fair chance to each
 *      qualified NIC and balances overall utilization.
 *
 *      2. If the process is bound, we compare providers in the list that have
 *      the same type as the first provider, and find the provider with the
 *      shortest distance to the current process. 
 * 
 *          i. If the provider has PCI BDF data, we attempt to compute the
 *          distance between the NIC and the current process cpuset. The NIC
 *          with the shortest distance is returned.
 * 
 *              * For equidistant NICs, we select a NIC in round-robin fashion
 *              using the package rank of the current process, i.e. (package
 *              rank % number of providers with the same distance).
 *
 *          ii. If we cannot compute the distance between the NIC and the
 *          current process, e.g. PCI BDF data is not available, a NIC will be
 *          selected in a round-robin fashion using package rank, i.e. (package
 *          rank % number of providers of the same type).
 *

 *                              selection. This provider is returned if the
 *                              NIC selection fails.
 * 
 * @param[in]   process_info    opal_process_info_t* The current process info
 *
 * @param[out]  provider        struct fi_info* object with the selected
