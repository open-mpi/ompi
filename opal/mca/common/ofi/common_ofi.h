/**
 * Selects NIC (provider) based on hardware locality
 *
 * In multi-nic situations, use hardware topology to pick the "best"
 * of the selected NICs.
 * There are 3 main cases that this covers:
 *
 *      1. If the first provider passed into this function is the only valid
 *      provider, this provider is returned.
 *
 *      2. If there is more than 1 provider that matches the type of the first
 *      provider in the list, and the BDF data
 *      is available then a provider is selected based on locality of device
 *      cpuset and process cpuset and tries to ensure that processes
 *      are distributed evenly across NICs. This has two separate
 *      cases:
 *
 *          i. There is one or more provider local to the process:
 *
 *              (local rank % number of providers of the same type
 *              that share the process cpuset) is used to select one
 *              of these providers.
 *
 *          ii. There is no provider that is local to the process:
 *
 *              (local rank % number of providers of the same type)
 *              is used to select one of these providers
 *
 *      3. If there is more than 1 providers of the same type in the
 *      list, and the BDF data is not available (the ofi version does
 *      not support fi_info.nic or the provider does not support BDF)
 *      then (local rank % number of providers of the same type) is
 *      used to select one of these providers
 *
 * @param provider_list (IN)   struct fi_info* An initially selected
 *                             provider NIC. The provider name and
 *                             attributes are used to restrict NIC
 *                             selection. This provider is returned if the
 *                             NIC selection fails.
 *
 * @param provider (OUT)       struct fi_info* object with the selected
 *                             provider if the selection succeeds
 *                             if the selection fails, returns the fi_info
 *                             object that was initially provided.
 *
 * All errors should be recoverable and will return the initially provided
 * provider. However, if an error occurs we can no longer guarantee
 * that the provider returned is local to the process or that the processes will
 * balance across available NICs.
