[unbound_process]
Open MPI's OFI driver detected multiple NICs on the system but cannot select an
optimal device because the current process is not bound. This may negatively
impact performance. This can be resolved by specifying "--bind-to ..." on
command line.

[package_rank failed]
Open MPI's OFI driver detected multiple equidistant NICs from the current process,
but had insufficient information to ensure MPI processes fairly pick a NIC for use.
This may negatively impact performance. A more modern PMIx server is necessary to
resolve this issue.

Note: This message is displayed only when the OFI component's verbosity level is
%d or higher.
