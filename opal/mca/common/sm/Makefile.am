# A word of explanation...
#
# This library is linked against various MCA components because all
# shared-memory based components (e.g., btl/sm, btl/smcuda, etc.)  need to
# share some common code and data.  There's two cases:
#
# 1. libmca_common_sm.la is a shared library.  By linking that shared
# library to all components that need it, the OS linker will
# automatically load it into the process as necessary, and there will
# only be one copy (i.e., all the components will share *one* copy of
# the code and data).
#
# 2. libmca_common_sm.la is a static library.  In this case, it will
# be rolled up into the top-level libmpi.la.  It will also be rolled
# into each component, but then the component will also be rolled up
# into the upper-level libmpi.la.  Linkers universally know how to
# "figure this out" so that we end up with only one copy of the code
# and data.
#
# Note that building this common component statically and linking
# against other dynamic components is *not* supported!

# Header files

headers = \
        common_sm.h \
        common_sm_mpool.h

# Source files

sources = \
        common_sm.c \
        common_sm_mpool.c

# Help file

dist_opaldata_DATA = help-mpi-common-sm.txt

# As per above, we'll either have an installable or noinst result.
# The installable one should follow the same MCA prefix naming rules
# (i.e., libmca_<type>_<name>.la).  The noinst one can be named
# whatever it wants, although libmca_<type>_<name>_noinst.la is
# recommended.

# To simplify components that link to this library, we will *always*
# have an output libtool library named libmca_<type>_<name>.la -- even
# for case 2) described above (i.e., so there's no conditional logic
# necessary in component Makefile.am's that link to this library).
# Hence, if we're creating a noinst version of this library (i.e.,
# case 2), we sym link it to the libmca_<type>_<name>.la name
# (libtool will do the Right Things under the covers).  See the
# all-local and clean-local rules, below, for how this is effected.
