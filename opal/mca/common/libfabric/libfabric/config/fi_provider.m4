dnl Macros to help setup FI providers

dnl
dnl Helper macro called from top-level configure.ac to get ready to
dnl configure providers.
dnl
AC_DEFUN([FI_PROVIDER_INIT],[
	PROVIDERS_TO_BUILD=
	PROVIDERS_DL=
	PROVIDERS_STATIC=
	PROVIDERS_COUNT=

	m4_include(config/fi_check_package.m4)

dnl
dnl Helper macro called from top-level configure.ac to finalize
dnl after all providers have been initialized
dnl
AC_DEFUN([FI_PROVIDER_FINI],[
	AC_SUBST(PROVIDERS_TO_BUILD)
	AC_SUBST(PROVIDERS_DL)
	AC_SUBST(PROVIDERS_STATIC)
])

dnl Helper macro called from top-level configure.ac to setup a
dnl provider.
dnl
dnl 1. Sets up --enable-<provider_name>
dnl 2. Checks for --enable-<provider_name>=dl;
dnl    sets $<provider_name>_dl to 0 or 1
dnl 3. Sets $enable_<provider_name> to "yes" or "no"
dnl 4. Calls <provider_name>_CONFIGURE m4 macro
dnl 5. If a directory was provider in --enable-<provider_name>, ensure
dnl    it is sane
dnl 6. Calls <provider_name>_CONDITIONALS m4 macro
dnl 7. Outputs whether this provider will be built or not, and if so,
dnl    whether it is static or a DSO
dnl
dnl Arguments:
dnl
dnl $1: provider name (must be same as directory name)
dnl
dnl Shell variable outputs:
dnl
dnl enable_$1: yes, no, or auto
dnl $1_dl: 1 if the provider is supposed to be built as a DSO, 0 otherwise
dnl
dnl AC_DEFINE outputs:
dnl
dnl HAVE_$1_DL: same value as $1_dl

dnl
dnl Helper macro that can use to check that a user-provided directory
dnl is valid as the root of an installation tree.  I.e., that it has an
dnl include and lib or lib64 directory.  This helps prevent users from
dnl specifying incorrect/invalid directories on the configure command line
dnl (e.g., typoing a directory name and then wondering why a given
dnl provider chooses not to build).
dnl
dnl Arguments:
dnl
dnl $1: directory to check
dnl
AC_DEFUN([FI_CHECK_PREFIX_DIR],[
	# Check that the base directory exists
	AS_IF([test ! -d "$1"],
	       [AC_MSG_WARN([supplied directory "$1" does not exist])
