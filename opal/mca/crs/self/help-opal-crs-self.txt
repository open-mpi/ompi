[self:no_callback]
Error: We were unable to find one of the following callbacks:
         %s =  %s_%s
         %s =  %s_%s
         %s =  %s_%s
       Possible causes of this problem are:
        - Linker did not export all of the proper symbols.
          This is usally enabled with a flag such as '-export'.
        - The function does not exist in your program.

       If you have a custom prefix for your functions you may specify
       them with the 'crs_self_prefix' mca parameter. For example,
         $ prog -mca crs_self_prefix my_prefix
       This will then look for the following functions:
         int my_prefix_checkpoint(void)
         int my_prefix_continue(void)
         int my_prefix_restart(void)
       Otherwise it will search for functions with the default prefix of:
           '%s'
#
[self:ckpt_disabled]
Error: The checkpointer is currently disabled.
       Unable to proceed with the checkpoint!
#
[self:no-restart-cmd]
Error: The checkpointer was unable to determine how to restart your
       application. Specify the restart command in the checkpoint
       function.
