\section hwloc_summary hwloc Summary

hwloc provides command line tools and a C API to obtain the
hierarchical map of key computing elements within a node, such as: NUMA memory
nodes, shared caches, processor packages, processor cores,
processing units (logical processors or "threads")
and even I/O devices.
hwloc also gathers various attributes such as
cache and memory information, and is portable across a variety of
different operating systems and platforms.
Additionally it may assemble the topologies of multiple machines
into a single one so as to let applications consult the topology
of an entire fabric or cluster at once.

hwloc primarily aims at helping high-performance computing (HPC)
applications, but is also applicable to any project seeking to exploit
code and/or data locality on modern computing platforms.

hwloc supports the following operating systems:

<ul>
<li>Linux (including old kernels not having sysfs topology
information, with knowledge of cpusets, ScaleMP vSMP support, etc.)
on all supported hardware, including Intel Xeon Phi
(KNL and KNC, either standalone or as a coprocessor)
and NumaScale NumaConnect.</li>
<li>Solaris (with support for processor sets and logical domains)</li>
<li>AIX</li>
<li>Darwin / OS X</li>
<li>FreeBSD and its variants (such as kFreeBSD/GNU)</li>
<li>NetBSD</li>
<li>HP-UX</li>
<li>Microsoft Windows</li>
<li>IBM BlueGene/Q Compute Node Kernel (CNK)</li>
</ul>

Since it uses standard Operating System information, hwloc's support is mostly
independant from the processor type (x86, powerpc, ...) and just relies on the
Operating System support. The main exception is BSD operating systems (NetBSD, FreeBSD, etc.)
because they do not provide support topology information, hence hwloc uses an x86-only CPUID-based
backend (which can be used for other OSes too, see the \ref plugins section).

To check whether hwloc works on a particular machine, just try to build it
and run <tt>lstopo</tt> or <tt>lstopo-no-graphics</tt>. If some things do not look right
(e.g. bogus or missing cache information), see \ref bugs.

hwloc only reports the number of processors on unsupported operating
systems; no topology information is available.

For development and debugging purposes, hwloc also offers the ability to
work on "fake" topologies:

<ul>
  <li> Symmetrical tree of resources generated from a list of level arities,
  see \ref synthetic.</li>
  <li> Remote machine simulation through the gathering of topology as XML files,
  see \ref xml.</li>
</ul>

hwloc can display the topology in a human-readable format, either in
graphical mode (X11), or by exporting in one of several different
formats, including: plain text, PDF, PNG, and FIG (see \ref cli_examples
below).  Note that some of the export formats require additional
support libraries.

hwloc offers a programming interface for manipulating topologies and
objects. It also brings a powerful CPU bitmap API that is used to
describe topology objects location on physical/logical processors. See
the \ref interface below. It may also be used to binding applications
onto certain cores or memory nodes. Several utility programs are also
provided to ease command-line manipulation of topology objects,
binding of processes, and so on.

Perl bindings are available from Bernd Kallies on
<a href=http://search.cpan.org/~bka/Sys-Hwloc-0.10/>CPAN</a>.

Python bindings are available from Guy Streeter:
<ul>
<li><a href=http://people.redhat.com/streeter/>Fedora RPM and tarball</a>.</li>
<li><a href=git://git.fedorahosted.org/python-hwloc.git>git tree</a>
(<a href=http://git.fedorahosted.org/git/python-hwloc.git>html</a>).</li>
</ul>

\section hwloc_installation hwloc Installation

The generic installation procedure for both hwloc and netloc
is described in \ref common_installation.

The hwloc command-line tool "lstopo" produces human-readable topology
maps, as mentioned above.  It can also export maps to the "fig" file
format.  Support for PDF, Postscript, and PNG exporting is provided if
the "Cairo" development package (usually <tt>cairo-devel</tt> or
<tt>libcairo2-dev</tt>) can be found in "lstopo" when hwloc
is configured and build.

The hwloc core may also benefit from the following development packages:
<ul>
<li>libpciaccess for full I/O device discovery
    (<tt>libpciaccess-devel</tt> or <tt>libpciaccess-dev</tt> package).
    On Linux, PCI discovery may still be performed (without vendor/device names)
    even if libpciaccess cannot be used.
</li>

<li>the AMD OpenCL implementation for OpenCL device discovery.
</li>
<li>the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit for CUDA device discovery.
</li>
<li>the NVIDIA Management Library (NVML) for NVML device discovery.
  It is included in CUDA since version 8.0.
  Older NVML releases were available within the NVIDIA GPU Deployment Kit
  from https://developer.nvidia.com/gpu-deployment-kit .
</li>
<li>the NV-CONTROL X extension library (NVCtrl) for NVIDIA display discovery.
  The relevant development package is usually <tt>libXNVCtrl-devel</tt>
  or <tt>libxnvctrl-dev</tt>.
  It is also available within nvidia-settings from ftp://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/nvidia-settings/
  and https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-settings/ .
</li>
<li>libxml2 for full XML import/export support (otherwise, the
    internal minimalistic parser will only be able to import
    XML files that were exported by the same hwloc release).
    See \ref xml for details.
    The relevant development package is usually <tt>libxml2-devel</tt>
    or <tt>libxml2-dev</tt>.
</li>
<li>libudev on Linux for easier discovery of OS device information
    (otherwise hwloc will try to manually parse udev raw files).
    The relevant development package is usually <tt>libudev-devel</tt>
    or <tt>libudev-dev</tt>.
</li>
<li>libtool's ltdl library for dynamic plugin loading.
  The relevant development package is usually <tt>libtool-ltdl-devel</tt>
  or <tt>libltdl-dev</tt>.
</li>
</ul>

PCI and XML support may be statically built inside the main hwloc
library, or as separate dynamically-loaded plugins (see the
\ref plugins section).

Note that because of the possibility of GPL taint, the
<tt>pciutils</tt> library <tt>libpci</tt> will not be used (remember
that hwloc is BSD-licensed).

\section interface Programming Interface

The basic interface is available in hwloc.h.
Some higher-level functions are available in hwloc/helper.h to reduce
the need to manually manipulate objects and follow links between them.
Documentation for all these is provided later in this document.
Developers may also want to look at hwloc/inlines.h which contains the
actual inline code of some hwloc.h routines, and at this document,
which provides good higher-level topology traversal examples.

To precisely define the vocabulary used by hwloc, a \ref termsanddefs
section is available and should probably be read first.  

Each hwloc object contains a cpuset describing the list of processing
units that it contains.  These bitmaps may be used for
\ref hwlocality_cpubinding and \ref hwlocality_membinding.
hwloc offers an extensive
bitmap manipulation interface in hwloc/bitmap.h.

Moreover, hwloc also comes with additional helpers for
interoperability with several commonly used environments.
See the \ref interoperability section for details.

The complete API documentation is available in a full set of HTML
pages, man pages, and self-contained PDF files (formatted for both
both US letter and A4 formats) in the source tarball in
doc/doxygen-doc/.  

<strong>NOTE:</strong> If you are building the documentation from a
Git clone, you will need to have Doxygen and pdflatex
installed -- the documentation will be built during the normal "make"
process.  The documentation is installed during "make install" to
$prefix/share/doc/hwloc/ and your systems default man page tree (under
$prefix, of course).

\subsection portability Portability

Operating System have varying support for CPU and memory binding,
e.g. while some Operating Systems provide interfaces for all kinds of CPU and
memory bindings, some others provide only interfaces for a limited number of
kinds of CPU and memory binding, and some do not provide any binding interface
at all.  Hwloc's binding functions would then simply return the ENOSYS error
(Function not implemented), meaning that the underlying Operating System
does not provide any interface for them. \ref hwlocality_cpubinding and
\ref hwlocality_membinding provide more information on which hwloc binding functions
should be preferred because interfaces for them are usually available on the
supported Operating Systems.

Similarly, the ability of reporting topology information varies from
one platform to another.
As shown in \ref cli_examples, hwloc can obtain information on a wide
variety of hardware topologies.  However, some platforms and/or
operating system versions will only report a subset of this
information.  For example, on an PPC64-based system with 8 cores
(each with 2 hardware threads) running a default 2.6.18-based kernel
from RHEL 5.4, hwloc is only able to glean information about NUMA
nodes and processor units (PUs).  No information about caches,
packages, or cores is available.

Here's the graphical output from lstopo on this platform when
Simultaneous Multi-Threading (SMT) is enabled:

\image html ppc64-with-smt.png
\image latex ppc64-with-smt.png "" width=\textwidth

And here's the graphical output from lstopo on this platform when SMT is
disabled:

\image html ppc64-without-smt.png
\image latex ppc64-without-smt.png "" width=.5\textwidth

Notice that hwloc only sees half the PUs when SMT is disabled.
PU L#6, for example, seems to change location from NUMA node #0 to #1.
In reality, no PUs "moved" -- they were simply re-numbered when hwloc
only saw half as many (see also Logical index in \ref termsanddefs_indexes).
Hence, PU L#6 in the SMT-disabled picture probably corresponds to
PU L#12 in the SMT-enabled picture.

This same "PUs have disappeared" effect can be seen on other platforms
-- even platforms / OSs that provide much more information than the
above PPC64 system.  This is an unfortunate side-effect of how
operating systems report information to hwloc.

Note that upgrading the Linux kernel on the same PPC64 system
mentioned above to 2.6.34, hwloc is able to discover all the topology
information.  The following picture shows the entire topology layout
when SMT is enabled:

\image html ppc64-full-with-smt.png
\image latex ppc64-full-with-smt.png "" width=\textwidth

Developers using the hwloc API or XML output for portable applications
should therefore be extremely careful to not make any assumptions
about the structure of data that is returned.  For example, per the
above reported PPC topology, it is not safe to assume that PUs will
always be descendants of cores.

Additionally, future hardware may insert new topology elements that
are not available in this version of hwloc.  Long-lived applications
that are meant to span multiple different hardware platforms should
also be careful about making structure assumptions.  For example,
a new element may someday exist between a core and a PU.


\subsection interface_example API Example

The following small C example (available in the source tree as ``doc/examples/hwloc-hello.c'')
prints the topology of the machine and performs some thread and memory binding.
More examples are available in the doc/examples/ directory of the source
tree.

\include examples/hwloc-hello.c

hwloc provides a \c pkg-config executable to obtain relevant compiler
and linker flags.  For example, it can be used thusly to compile
applications that utilize the hwloc library (assuming GNU Make):

\verbatim
CFLAGS += $(shell pkg-config --cflags hwloc)
LDLIBS += $(shell pkg-config --libs hwloc)

hwloc-hello: hwloc-hello.c
        $(CC) hwloc-hello.c $(CFLAGS) -o hwloc-hello $(LDLIBS)
\endverbatim

On a machine 2 processor packages -- each package of
which has two processing cores -- the output from running \c
hwloc-hello could be something like the following:

\verbatim
shell$ ./hwloc-hello

\section history History / Credits

hwloc is the evolution and merger of the libtopology
(http://runtime.bordeaux.inria.fr/libtopology/) project and the Portable
Linux Processor Affinity (PLPA) (http://www.open-mpi.org/projects/plpa/)
project. Because of functional and ideological overlap, these two code bases
and ideas were merged and released under the name "hwloc" as an Open MPI
sub-project.

libtopology was initially developed by the inria Runtime Team-Project
(http://runtime.bordeaux.inria.fr/) (headed by Raymond Namyst
(http://dept-info.labri.fr/~namyst/). PLPA was initially developed by
the Open MPI development team as a sub-project. Both are now deprecated
in favor of hwloc, which is distributed as an Open MPI sub-project.

<div class="section" id="termsanddefs_objects">
\endhtmlonly
\section termsanddefs_objects Objects

<dl>

<dt>Object</dt>
  <dd>Interesting kind of part of the system, such as a Core, a L2Cache,
  a NUMA memory node, etc. The different types detected by hwloc are
  detailed in the ::hwloc_obj_type_t enumeration.

  There are four kinds of Objects: Memory (NUMA nodes), I/O (Bridges, PCI and OS devices),
  Misc, and Normal (everything else, including Machine, Package, Core, PU, CPU Caches, etc.).
  Normal and Memory objects have (non-NULL) CPU sets and nodesets, while I/O and Misc don't.

  Objects are topologically sorted by locality (CPU and node sets)
  into a tree (see \ref termsanddefs_tree).
  </dd>

<dt>Processing Unit (or Logical Processor)</dt>
  <dd>The smallest processing element that can be represented by a hwloc
  object. It may be a single-core processor, a core of a multicore
  processor, or a single thread in a SMT processor.
  hwloc's PU acronym stands for Processing Unit.

  "Logical processor" should not be confused with "Logical index of a
  processor".
  </dd>

<dt>Package</dt>
  <dd>A processor Package is the physical package that usually gets
  inserted into a socket on the motherboard.
  It is also often called a physical processor or a CPU even if these
  names bring confusion with respect to cores and processing units.
  A processor package usually contains multiple cores
  (and may also be composed of multiple dies).
  hwloc Package objects were called Sockets up to hwloc 1.10.
  </dd>

<dt>NUMA Node</dt>
  <dd>
  An object that contains memory that is directly and byte-accessible
  to the host processors.
  It is usually close to some cores as specified by its CPU set.
  Hence it is attached as a memory child of the object that groups
  those cores together, for instance a Package objects with 4 Core children
  (see \ref termsanddefs_tree).
  </dd>

</dl>


\htmlonly
</div><div class="section" id="termsanddefs_indexes">
\endhtmlonly
\section termsanddefs_indexes Indexes and Sets

<dl>

<dt>OS or physical index</dt>
  <dd>The index that the operating system (OS) uses to identify the
  object.  This may be completely arbitrary, non-unique, non-contiguous, not
  representative of logical proximity, and may depend on the BIOS
  configuration. That is why hwloc almost never uses them, only in the default
  lstopo output (<tt>P\#x</tt>) and cpuset masks.
  See also \ref faq_indexes.</dd>

<dt>Logical index</dt>
  <dd>Index to uniquely identify objects of the same type and depth,
  automatically computed by hwloc according to the topology.  It expresses
  logical proximity in a generic way, i.e. objects which have adjacent logical
  indexes are adjacent in the topology. That is why hwloc almost always uses
  it in its API, since it expresses logical proximity. They can be shown (as
  <tt>L\#x</tt>) by <tt>lstopo</tt> thanks to the <tt>-l</tt> option.  This index
  is always linear and in
  the range [0, num_objs_same_type_same_level-1].  Think of it as ``cousin
  rank.'' The ordering is based on topology first, and then on OS CPU numbers,
  so it is stable across everything except firmware CPU renumbering.
  "Logical index" should not be confused with "Logical processor". A "Logical
  processor" (which in hwloc we rather call "processing unit" to avoid the
  confusion) has both a physical index (as chosen arbitrarily by BIOS/OS) and a logical
  index (as computed according to logical proximity by hwloc).
  See also \ref faq_indexes.</dd>

<dt>CPU set</dt>
  <dd>The set of logical processors (or processing units) logically included in an object
  (if it makes sense).  They are always expressed using physical logical
  processor numbers (as announced by the OS).  They are implemented as the
  ::hwloc_bitmap_t opaque structure.  hwloc CPU sets are just masks, they
  do \em not have any relation with an operating system actual binding notion like
  Linux' cpusets.
  I/O and Misc objects do not have CPU sets while all Normal and Memory objects have non-NULL CPU sets.</dd>

<dt>Node set</dt>
  <dd>The set of NUMA memory nodes logically included in an object
  (if it makes sense).  They are always expressed using physical node
  numbers (as announced by the OS).  They are implemented with the
  ::hwloc_bitmap_t opaque structure.
  as bitmaps.
  I/O and Misc objects do not have Node sets while all Normal and Memory objects have non-NULL nodesets.</dd>

<dt>Bitmap</dt>
  <dd>A possibly-infinite set of bits used for describing sets of objects
  such as CPUs (CPU sets) or memory nodes (Node sets). They are implemented
  with the ::hwloc_bitmap_t opaque structure.
</dd>

\section termsanddefs_tree Hierarchy, Tree and Levels

<dl>

<dt>Parent object</dt>
  <dd>The object logically containing the current object, for example
  because its CPU set includes the CPU set of the current object.</dd>

<dt>Ancestor object</dt>
  <dd>The parent object, or its own parent object, and so on.</dd>

<dt>Children object(s)</dt>
  <dd>The object (or objects) contained in the current object because
  their CPU set is included in the CPU set of the current object.
  Each object may also contain separated lists for Memory, I/O and Misc object children.
  </dd>

<dt>Arity</dt>
  <dd>The number of normal children of an object.
  There are also specific arities for Memory, I/O and Misc children.
  </dd>

<dt>Sibling objects</dt>
  <dd>Objects in the same children list, which all of them are normal
  children of the same parent, or all of them are Memory children of
  the same parent, or I/O children, or Misc.
  They usually have the same type (and hence are cousins, as well).
  But they may not if the topology is asymmetric.
  </dd>

<dt>Sibling rank</dt>
  <dd>Index to uniquely identify objects which have
  the same parent, and is always in the range [0, arity-1]
  (respectively memory_arity, io_arity or misc_arity for Memory, I/O
  and Misc children of a parent).</dd>

<dt>Cousin objects</dt>
  <dd>Objects of the same type (and depth) as the current object,
  even if they do not have the same parent.</dd>

<dt>Level</dt>
  <dd>Set of objects of the same type and depth. All these objects
  are cousins.

  Memory, I/O and Misc objects also have their own specific levels and (virtual) depth.
  </dd>

<dt>Depth</dt>
  <dd>Nesting level in the object tree, starting from the root object.
  If the topology is symmetric, the depth of a child is equal to the
  parent depth plus one, and an object depth is also equal to the number
  of parent/child links between the root object and the given object.
  If the topology is asymmetric, the difference between some parent
  and child depths may be larger than one when some intermediate levels
  (for instance groups) are missing in only some parts of the machine.

  Memory, I/O and Misc objects also have their own specific levels and depth.
  </dd>

</dl>

The following diagram can help to understand the vocabulary of the relationships
by showing the example of a machine with two dual core packages (with no
hardware threads); thus, a topology with 5 levels. Each box with rounded corner
corresponds to one ::hwloc_obj_t, containing the values of the different integer
fields (depth, logical_index, etc.), and arrows show to which other ::hwloc_obj_t
pointers point to (first_child, parent, etc.).

Objects of the same level (cousins) are listed in red boxes and linked
with red arrows.
Children of the same parent (siblings) are linked with blue arrows.

The L2 cache of the last core is intentionally missing to show how asymmetric topologies are handled.
See \ref faq_asymmetric for more information about such strange topologies.

\image latex diagram.eps "" width=\textwidth

It should be noted that for PU objects, the logical index -- as
computed linearly by hwloc -- is not the same as the OS index.

The NUMA node is on the side because it is not part of the main tree
but rather attached to the object that corresponds to its locality
(the entire machine here, hence the root object).
It is attached as a <i>Memory</i> child (in green) and has a virtual depth (negative).
It could also have siblings if there were multiple local NUMA nodes,
or cousins if other NUMA nodes were attached somewhere else in the machine.

I/O or Misc object could be attached in a similar manner.



\page tools Command-Line Tools 

\htmlonly
<div class="section">
\endhtmlonly

hwloc comes with an extensive C programming interface and several
command line utilities. Each of them is fully documented in its own
manual page; the following is a summary of the available command line
tools.


\htmlonly
</div><div class="section" id="cli_lstopo">
\endhtmlonly
\section cli_lstopo lstopo and lstopo-no-graphics

lstopo (also known as hwloc-ls) displays the
hierarchical topology map of the current system.  The output may be
graphical, ascii-art or textual, and can also be exported to numerous file
formats such as PDF, PNG, XML, and others.
Advanced graphical outputs require the "Cairo" development package
(usually <tt>cairo-devel</tt> or <tt>libcairo2-dev</tt>).

lstopo and lstopo-no-graphics accept the same command-line options.
However, graphical outputs are only available in lstopo.
Textual outputs (those that do not depend on heavy external libraries
such as Cairo) are supported in both lstopo and lstopo-no-graphics.

This command can also display the processes currently bound to a part
of the machine (via the <tt>\--ps</tt> option).

Note that lstopo can read XML files and/or alternate chroot
filesystems and display topological maps representing those systems
(e.g., use lstopo to output an XML file on one system, and then use
lstopo to read in that XML file and display it on a different system).


\htmlonly
</div><div class="section" id="cli_hwloc_bind">
\endhtmlonly
\section cli_hwloc_bind hwloc-bind

hwloc-bind binds processes to specific hardware objects through a
flexible syntax.  A simple example is binding an executable to
specific cores (or packages or bitmaps or ...).  The hwloc-bind(1) man
page provides much more detail on what is possible.

hwloc-bind can also be used to retrieve the current process' binding,
or retrieve the last CPU(s) where a process ran,
or operate on memory binding.

Just like hwloc-calc, the input locations given to hwloc-bind may be
either objects or cpusets (bitmaps as reported by hwloc-calc or hwloc-distrib).


\htmlonly
</div><div class="section" id="cli_hwloc_calc">
\endhtmlonly
\section cli_hwloc_calc hwloc-calc

hwloc-calc is hwloc's Swiss Army Knife command-line tool for converting things.
The input may be either objects or cpusets (bitmaps as reported by another hwloc-calc instance or by hwloc-distrib),
that may be combined by addition, intersection or subtraction.
The output kinds include:
<ul>
<li>a cpuset bitmap: This compact opaque representation of objects is useful for shell scripts etc.
It may passed to hwloc command-line tools such as hwloc-calc or hwloc-bind,
or to hwloc command-line options such as <tt>lstopo \--restrict</tt>.</li>
<li>the amount of the equivalent hwloc objects from a specific type, or the list of their indexes.
This is useful for iterating over all similar objects (for instance all cores) within a given
part of a platform.</li>
<li>a hierarchical description of objects,
for instance a thread index within a core within a package.
This gives a better view of the actual location of an object.</li>
</ul>

Moreover, input and/or output may be use either physical/OS object
indexes or as hwloc's logical object indexes.
It eases cooperation with external tools such as taskset or numactl
by exporting hwloc specifications into list of processor or NUMA node
physical indexes.
See also \ref faq_indexes.


\htmlonly
</div><div class="section" id="cli_hwloc_info">
\endhtmlonly
\section cli_hwloc_info hwloc-info

hwloc-info dumps information about the given objects, as well as all its specific attributes.
It is intended to be used with tools such as grep for filtering
certain attribute lines.
When no object is specified, or when <tt>\--topology</tt> is passed,
hwloc-info prints a summary of the topology.
When <tt>\--support</tt> is passed, hwloc-info lists the supported
features for the topology.


\htmlonly
</div><div class="section" id="cli_hwloc_distrib">
\endhtmlonly
\section cli_hwloc_distrib hwloc-distrib

hwloc-distrib generates a set of cpuset bitmaps that are uniformly
distributed across the machine for the given number of processes.
These strings may be used with hwloc-bind to run processes to maximize
their memory bandwidth by properly distributing them across the
machine.


\htmlonly
</div><div class="section" id="cli_hwloc_ps">
\endhtmlonly
\section cli_hwloc_ps hwloc-ps

hwloc-ps is a tool to display the bindings of processes that are
currently running on the local machine.  By default, hwloc-ps only
lists processes that are bound; unbound process (and Linux kernel
threads) are not displayed.


\htmlonly
</div><div class="section" id="cli_hwloc_annotate">
\endhtmlonly
\section cli_hwloc_annotate hwloc-annotate

hwloc-annotate may add object attributes such as string information
(see \ref attributes_info for details) or Misc children objects.
It reads an input topology from a XML file and outputs
the annotated topology as another XML file.


\htmlonly
</div><div class="section" id="cli_hwloc_diffpatchcompress">
\endhtmlonly
\section cli_hwloc_diffpatchcompress hwloc-diff, hwloc-patch and hwloc-compress-dir

hwloc-diff computes the difference between two topologies
and outputs it to another XML file.

hwloc-patch reads such a difference file and applies to
another topology.

hwloc-compress-dir compresses an entire directory of XML
files by using hwloc-diff to save the differences between
topologies instead of entire topologies.


\htmlonly
</div><div class="section" id="cli_hwloc_dump_hwdata">
\endhtmlonly
\section cli_hwloc_dump_hwdata hwloc-dump-hwdata

hwloc-dump-hwdata is a Linux and x86-specific tool that dumps
(during boot, privileged) some topology and locality information
from raw hardware files (SMBIOS and ACPI tables) to human-readable
and world-accessible files that the hwloc library will later reuse.

Currently only used on Intel Knights Landing Xeon Phi platforms.
See \ref faq_knl_dump.

See <tt>HWLOC_DUMPED_HWDATA_DIR</tt> in \ref envvar for details
about the location of dumped files.


\htmlonly
</div><div class="section" id="cli_hwloc_gather">
\endhtmlonly
\section cli_hwloc_gather hwloc-gather-topology and hwloc-gather-cpuid

hwloc-gather-topology is a Linux-specific tool that saves the
relevant topology files of the current machine into a tarball
(and the corresponding lstopo outputs).

hwloc-gather-cpuid is a x86-specific tool that dumps the
result of CPUID instructions on the current machine into
a directory.

These files may be used later (possibly offline) for simulating
or debugging a machine without actually running on it.




\page envvar Environment Variables

\htmlonly
<div class="section">
\endhtmlonly

The behavior of the hwloc library and tools may be tuned thanks to the
following environment variables.

<dl>

<dt>HWLOC_XMLFILE=/path/to/file.xml</dt>
  <dd>enforces the discovery from the given XML file as if
  hwloc_topology_set_xml() had been called.
  This file may have been generated earlier with lstopo file.xml.
  For convenience, this backend provides empty binding hooks which just
  return success.  To have hwloc still actually call OS-specific hooks,
  HWLOC_THISSYSTEM should be set 1 in the environment too, to assert that
  the loaded file is really the underlying system.
  See also \ref xml.
  </dd>

<dt>HWLOC_SYNTHETIC=synthetic_description</dt>
  <dd>enforces the discovery through a synthetic description string
  as if hwloc_topology_set_synthetic() had been called.
  For convenience, this backend provides empty binding hooks which just
  return success.
  See also \ref synthetic.
  </dd>

<dt>HWLOC_XML_VERBOSE=1</dt>
<dt>HWLOC_SYNTHETIC_VERBOSE=1</dt>
  <dd>enables verbose messages in the XML or synthetic topology backends.
  hwloc XML backends (see \ref xml) can emit some error messages to
  the error output stream.
  Enabling these verbose messages within hwloc can be useful for
  understanding failures to parse input XML topologies.
  Similarly, enabling verbose messages in the synthetic topology
  backend can help understand why the description string is invalid.
  See also \ref synthetic.
  </dd>

<dt>HWLOC_THISSYSTEM=1</dt>
  <dd>enforces the return value of hwloc_topology_is_thissystem(), as if
  ::HWLOC_TOPOLOGY_FLAG_IS_THISSYSTEM was set with hwloc_topology_set_flags().
  It means that it makes hwloc assume that the selected backend provides the
  topology for the system on which we are running, even if it is not the
  OS-specific backend but the XML backend for instance.
  This means making the binding functions actually call the OS-specific
  system calls and really do binding, while the XML backend would otherwise
  provide empty hooks just returning success.
  This can be used for efficiency reasons to first detect the topology once,
  save it to an XML file, and quickly reload it later through the XML
  backend, but still having binding functions actually do bind.
  This also enables support for the variable HWLOC_THISSYSTEM_ALLOWED_RESOURCES.
  </dd>

<dt>HWLOC_THISSYSTEM_ALLOWED_RESOURCES=1</dt>
  <dd>Get the set of allowed resources from the native operating system
  even if the topology was loaded from XML or synthetic description,
  as if ::HWLOC_TOPOLOGY_FLAG_THISSYSTEM_ALLOWED_RESOURCES was set
  with hwloc_topology_set_flags().
  This variable requires the topology to match the current system
  (see the variable HWLOC_THISSYSTEM).
  This is useful when the topology is not loaded directly from the
  local machine (e.g. for performance reason) and it comes with all
  resources, but the running process is restricted to only a part
  of the machine (for instance because of Linux Cgroup/Cpuset).
  </dd>

<dt>HWLOC_HIDE_ERRORS=0</dt>
  <dd>enables or disables verbose reporting of errors.
  The hwloc library may issue warnings to the standard error stream
  when it detects a problem during topology discovery, for instance
  if the operating system (or user) gives contradictory topology
  information.   Setting this environment variable to 1 removes the
  actual displaying of these error messages.
  </dd>

<dt>HWLOC_GROUPING=1</dt>
  <dd>enables or disables objects grouping based on distances.
  By default, hwloc uses distance matrices between objects (either read
  from the OS or given by the user) to find groups of close objects.
  These groups are described by adding intermediate Group objects in the topology.
  Setting this environment variable to 0 will disable this grouping.
  This variable supersedes the obsolete HWLOC_IGNORE_DISTANCES variable.
  </dd>

<dt>HWLOC_GROUPING_ACCURACY=0.05</dt>
  <dd>relaxes distance comparison during grouping.
  By default, objects may be grouped if their distances form a minimal
  distance graph. When setting this variable to 0.02, and when
  ::HWLOC_DISTANCES_ADD_FLAG_GROUP_INACCURATE is given, these distances
  do not have to be strictly equal anymore, they may just be equal
  with a 2% error.
  If set to <tt>try</tt> instead of a numerical value, hwloc will try
  to group with perfect accuracy (0, the default), then with 0.01, 0.02,
  0.05 and finally 0.1.
  Numbers given in this environment variable should always use a dot
  as a decimal mark (for instance 0.01 instead of 0,01).</dd>

<dt>HWLOC_GROUPING_VERBOSE=0</dt>
  <dd>enables or disables some verbose messages during grouping.
  If this variable is set to 1, some debug messages will be displayed
  during distance-based grouping of objects even if debug was not specific
  at configure time.
  This is useful when trying to find an interesting distance grouping
  accuracy.</dd>

<dt>HWLOC_PCI_LOCALITY=&lt;domain/bus&gt; &lt;cpuset&gt;;...</dt>
<dt>HWLOC_PCI_LOCALITY=/path/to/pci/locality/file</dt>
<dd>changes the locality of I/O devices behing the specified PCI buses.
  If no I/O locality information is available or if the BIOS reports
  incorrect information, it is possible to move a I/O device tree
  (OS and/or PCI devices with optional bridges)
  near a custom set of processors.
  <br/>
  Localities are given either inside the environment variable itself,
  or in the pointed file.
  They may be separated either by semi-colons or by line-breaks.
  <br/>
  Each locality contains a domain/bus specification (in hexadecimal numbers as usual)
  followed by a whitespace and a cpuset:
  <ul>
  <li><tt>0001 &lt;cpuset&gt;</tt> specifies the locality of all buses in PCI domain 0000.</li>
  <li><tt>0000:0f &lt;cpuset&gt;</tt> specifies only PCI bus 0f in domain 0000.</li>
  <li><tt>0002:04-0a &lt;cpuset&gt;</tt> specifies a range of buses (from 04 to 0a) within domain 0002.</li>
  </ul>
  Domain/bus specifications should usually match entire hierarchies of buses
  behind a bridge (including primary, secondary and subordinate buses).
  For instance, if hostbridge 0000:00 contains other bridges creating buses 0000:01 to 0000:09,
  the variable should be HWLOC_PCI_LOCALITY="0000:00-09 <cpuset>".
  It supersedes the old HWLOC_PCI_0000_00_LOCALCPUS=&lt;cpuset&gt;
  which only works when hostbridges exist in the topology.
  <br/>
  If the variable is defined to empty or invalid, no forced PCI locality is applied
  but hwloc's internal automatic locality quirks are disabled, which means the exact
  PCI locality reported by the platform is used.
  </dd>

<dt>HWLOC_FSROOT=/path/to/linux/filesystem-root/</dt>
  <dd>switches to reading the topology from the specified
  Linux filesystem root instead of the main file-system root.
  This directory may have been saved previously from another machine
  with <tt>hwloc-gather-topology</tt>.
  <br/>
  One should likely also set <tt>HWLOC_COMPONENTS=linux,linuxio,stop</tt>
  so that non-Linux backends are disabled
  (the <tt>-i</tt> option of command-line tools takes care of both).
  <br/>
  Not using the main file-system root causes hwloc_topology_is_thissystem()
  to return 0.
  For convenience, this backend provides empty binding hooks which just
  return success.  To have hwloc still actually call OS-specific hooks,
  HWLOC_THISSYSTEM should be set 1 in the environment too, to assert that
  the loaded file is really the underlying system.
  </dd>

<dt>HWLOC_CPUID_PATH=/path/to/cpuid/</dt>
  <dd>forces the x86 backend to read dumped CPUIDs from the given directory
  instead of executing actual x86 CPUID instructions.
  This directory may have been saved previously from another machine
  with <tt>hwloc-gather-cpuid</tt>.
  <br/>
  One should likely also set <tt>HWLOC_COMPONENTS=x86,stop</tt>
  so that non-x86 backends are disabled
  (the <tt>-i</tt> option of command-line tools takes care of both).
  <br/>
  It causes hwloc_topology_is_thissystem() to return 0.
  For convenience, this backend provides empty binding hooks which just
  return success.  To have hwloc still actually call OS-specific hooks,
  HWLOC_THISSYSTEM should be set 1 in the environment too, to assert that
  the loaded CPUID dump is really the underlying system.
  </dd>

<dt>HWLOC_DUMPED_HWDATA_DIR=/path/to/dumped/files/</dt>
  <dd>loads files dumped by <tt>hwloc-dump-hwdata</tt> (on Linux)
  from the given directory.
  The default dump/load directory is configured during build based
  on \--runstatedir, \--localstatedir, and \--prefix options.
  It usually points to <tt>/var/run/hwloc/</tt> in Linux distribution
  packages, but it may also point to <tt>$prefix/var/run/hwloc/</tt>
  when manually installing and only specifying \--prefix.
  </dd>

<dt>HWLOC_COMPONENTS=list,of,components</dt>
  <dd>forces a list of components to enable or disable.
  Enable or disable the given comma-separated list of components
  (if they do not conflict with each other). Component names prefixed with
  <tt>-</tt> are disabled.
  Once the end of the list is reached, hwloc falls back to
  enabling the remaining components (sorted by priority) that do not
  conflict with the already enabled ones, and unless explicitly disabled in the
  list.
  If <tt>stop</tt> is met, the enabling loop immediately stops, no
  more component is enabled.

  If <tt>xml</tt> or <tt>synthetic</tt> components are selected,
  the corresponding XML filename or synthetic description string
  should be pass in <tt>HWLOC_XMLFILE</tt> or <tt>HWLOC_SYNTHETIC</tt>
  respectively.

  Since this variable is the low-level and more generic way to
  select components, it takes precedence over environment variables
  for selecting components.

  If the variable is set to an empty string (or set to a single comma),
  no specific component is loaded first, all components are loaded
  in priority order.

  See \ref plugins_select for details.
  </dd>

<dt>HWLOC_COMPONENTS_VERBOSE=1</dt>
  <dd>displays verbose information about components.
  Display messages when components are registered or enabled.
  This is the recommended way to list the available components
  with their priority

  </dd>

<dt>HWLOC_PLUGINS_PATH=/path/to/hwloc/plugins/:...</dt>
  <dd>changes the default search directory for plugins.
  By default, <tt>$libdir/hwloc</tt> is used.

\page cpu_mem_bind CPU and Memory Binding Overview

\htmlonly
<div class="section">
\endhtmlonly

Some operating systems do not systematically provide separate
functions for CPU and memory binding.  This means that CPU binding
functions may have have effects on the memory binding policy.
Likewise, changing the memory binding policy may change the CPU
binding of the current thread.  This is often not a problem for
applications, so by default hwloc will make use of these functions
when they provide better binding support.

If the application does not want the CPU binding to change when
changing the memory policy, it needs to use the
::HWLOC_MEMBIND_NOCPUBIND flag to prevent hwloc from using OS functions
which would change the CPU binding.  Additionally,
::HWLOC_CPUBIND_NOMEMBIND can be passed to CPU binding function to
prevent hwloc from using OS functions would change the memory binding
policy.  Of course, using these flags will reduce hwloc's overall support for
binding, so their use is discouraged.

One can avoid using these flags but still closely control both memory
and CPU binding by allocating memory, touching each page in the
allocated memory, and then changing the CPU binding.  The
already-really-allocated memory will then be "locked" to physical
memory and will not be migrated.  Thus, even if the memory binding
policy gets changed by the CPU binding order, the already-allocated
memory will not change with it.  When binding and allocating further
memory, the CPU binding should be performed again in case the memory
binding altered the previously-selected CPU binding.

Not all operating systems support the notion of a "current" memory
binding policy for the current process, but such operating systems often still
provide a way to allocate data on a given node set.  Conversely, some
operating systems support the notion of a "current" memory binding policy and do
not permit allocating data on a specific node set without changing the
current policy and allocate the data. To provide the most powerful coverage of
these facilities, hwloc provides:

<ul>
<li>functions that set/get the current memory binding policies (if supported):
hwloc_set/get_membind() and hwloc_set/get_proc_membind()
<li>a function that allocates memory bound to specific node set without changing
the current memory binding policy (if supported): hwloc_alloc_membind().
<li>a helper which, if needed, changes the current memory binding policy of the
process in order to obtain memory binding: hwloc_alloc_membind_policy().
</ul>

An application can thus use the two first sets of functions if it wants to
manage separately the global process binding policy and directed allocation,
or use the third set of functions if it does not care about the process memory
binding policy.

See \ref hwlocality_cpubinding and \ref hwlocality_membinding for
hwloc's API functions regarding CPU and memory binding, respectively.
There are some examples under doc/examples/ in the source tree.



\page iodevices I/O Devices

\htmlonly
<div class="section">
\endhtmlonly

hwloc usually manipulates processing units and memory but it can also
discover I/O devices and report their locality as well.
This is useful for placing I/O intensive applications on cores near the
I/O devices they use, or for gathering information about all platform
components.


\htmlonly
</div><div class="section" id="iodevices_enabling">
\endhtmlonly
\section iodevices_enabling Enabling and requirements

I/O discovery is disabled by default (except in lstopo) for performance
reasons.
It can be enabled by changing the filtering of I/O object types to
<tt>::HWLOC_TYPE_FILTER_KEEP_IMPORTANT</tt> or <tt>::HWLOC_TYPE_FILTER_KEEP_ALL</tt>
before loading the topology, for instance with <tt>hwloc_topology_set_io_types_filter()</tt>.

Note that I/O discovery requires significant help from the operating system.
The pciaccess library (the development package is usually <tt>libpciaccess-devel</tt>
or <tt>libpciaccess-dev</tt>) is needed to fully detect PCI devices and bridges.
On Linux, PCI discovery may still be performed even if <tt>libpciaccess</tt> cannot
be used. But it misses PCI device names.
Moreover, some operating systems require privileges for probing PCI devices,
see \ref faq_privileged for details.

The actual locality of I/O devices is only currently detected on Linux.
Other operating system will just report I/O devices as being attached
to the topology root object.


\htmlonly
</div><div class="section" id="iodevices_objects">
\endhtmlonly
\section iodevices_objects I/O objects

When I/O discovery is enabled and supported, some additional objects
are added to the topology.
The corresponding I/O object types are:
<ul><li>
<tt>::HWLOC_OBJ_OS_DEVICE</tt> describes an operating-system-specific
handle such as the <em>sda</em> drive or the <em>eth0</em> network interface.
See \ref iodevices_osdev.
</li><li>
<tt>::HWLOC_OBJ_PCI_DEVICE</tt> and <tt>::HWLOC_OBJ_BRIDGE</tt> build up
a PCI hierarchy made of devices and bridges.
See \ref iodevices_pci.
</li></ul>
Any of these types may be filtered individually with <tt>hwloc_topology_set_type_filter()</tt>.

hwloc tries to attach these new objects to normal objects
(usually NUMA nodes) to match their actual physical location.
For instance, if a I/O Hub is physically connected to a package,
the corresponding hwloc bridge object (and its PCI bridges and devices children)
is inserted as a child of the corresponding hwloc Package object.
<b>These children are not in the normal children list but rather in the I/O-specific
children list.</b>

I/O objects also have neither CPU sets nor node sets (NULL pointers) because
they are not directly usable by the user applications for binding.
Moreover I/O hierarchies may be highly complex (asymmetric trees of bridges).
So I/O objects are placed in specific levels with custom depths.
Their lists may still be traversed with regular helpers such as
hwloc_get_next_obj_by_type().
However, hwloc offers some dedicated helpers such as hwloc_get_next_pcidev()
and hwloc_get_next_osdev() for convenience (see \ref hwlocality_advanced_io).


\htmlonly
</div><div class="section" id="iodevices_osdev">
\endhtmlonly
\section iodevices_osdev OS devices

Although each PCI device is uniquely identified by its bus ID
(e.g. 0000:01:02.3), a user-space application can hardly find out which
PCI device it is actually using.
Applications rather use software handles
(such as the <em>eth0</em> network interface,
 the <em>sda</em> hard drive,
 or the <em>mlx4_0</em> OpenFabrics HCA).
Therefore hwloc tries to add software devices
(<tt>::HWLOC_OBJ_OS_DEVICE</tt>, also known as OS devices).

OS devices may be attached below PCI devices, but they may also be
attached directly to normal objects.
Indeed some OS devices are not related to PCI.
For instance, NVDIMM block devices (such as <em>pmem0s</em> on Linux)
are directly attached near their NUMA node
(I/O child of the parent whose memory child is the NUMA node).
Also, if hwloc could not discover PCI for some reason, PCI-related
OS devices may also be attached directly to normal objects.

hwloc first tries to discover OS devices from the operating system,
e.g. <em>eth0</em>, <em>sda</em> or <em>mlx4_0</em>.
However, this ability is currently only available on Linux for some
classes of devices.

hwloc then tries to discover software devices through additional
I/O components using external libraries.
For instance proprietary graphics drivers do not expose any named OS device,
but hwloc may still create one OS object per software handle when
supported.
For instance the <tt>opencl</tt> and <tt>cuda</tt> components may
add some <em>opencl0d0</em> and <em>cuda0</em> OS device objects.

Here is a list of OS device objects commonly created by hwloc

\section iodevices_pci PCI devices and bridges

A PCI hierarchy is usually organized as follows:
A hostbridge object ( <tt>::HWLOC_OBJ_BRIDGE</tt> object with upstream
type <em>Host</em> and downstream type <em>PCI</em>) is attached below
a normal object (usually the entire machine or a NUMA node).
There may be multiple hostbridges in the machine, attached to
different places, but all PCI devices are below one of them
(unless the Bridge object type is filtered-out).

Each hostbridge contains one or several children, either other bridges
(usually PCI to PCI) or PCI devices (<tt>::HWLOC_OBJ_PCI_DEVICE</tt>).
The number of bridges between the hostbridge and a PCI device depends
on the machine.


\htmlonly
</div><div class="section" id="iodevices_consult">
\endhtmlonly
\section iodevices_consult Consulting I/O devices and binding

I/O devices may be consulted by traversing the topology manually
(with usual routines such as hwloc_get_obj_by_type()) or by using
dedicated helpers (such as hwloc_get_pcidev_by_busid(), see
\ref hwlocality_advanced_io).

I/O objects do not actually contain any locality information because
their CPU sets and node sets are NULL.
Their locality must be retrieved by walking up the object tree
(through the <tt>parent</tt> link) until an non-I/O object is found
(see hwloc_get_non_io_ancestor_obj()).
This normal object should have non-NULL CPU sets and node sets
which describe the processing units and memory that are immediately
close to the I/O device.
For instance the path from a OS device to its locality may go
across a PCI device parent, one or several bridges, up to
a Package node with the same locality.

Command-line tools are also aware of I/O devices.
lstopo displays the interesting ones by default
(passing <tt>\--no-io</tt> disables it).

hwloc-calc and hwloc-bind may manipulate I/O devices specified
by PCI bus ID or by OS device name.
<ul>
<li>
 <tt>pci=0000:02:03.0</tt> is replaced by the set
 of CPUs that are close to the PCI device whose bus ID is given.
</li>
<li>
 <tt>os=eth0</tt> is replaced by CPUs that are close to the I/O
 device whose software handle is called <tt>eth0</tt>.
</li>
</ul>
This enables easy binding of I/O-intensive applications near the
device they use.

The following picture shows a dual-package dual-core host whose
PCI bus is connected to the first package and NUMA node.

Six interesting PCI devices were discovered.
However, hwloc found some corresponding software devices
(<em>eth0</em>, <em>eth1</em>, <em>sda</em>, <em>mlx4_0</em>,
<em>ib0</em>, and <em>ib1</em>) for only four of these physical
devices.
The other ones (<em>PCI 102b:0532</em> and <em>PCI 8086:3a20</em>)
are an unused IDE controller (no disk attached)
and a graphic card (no corresponding software device reported
to the user by the operating system).

On the contrary, it should be noted that three different software
devices were found for the last PCI device (<em>PCI 15b3:634a</em>).
Indeed this OpenFabrics HCA PCI device object contains one
one OpenFabrics software device (<em>mlx4_0</em>) and two virtual
network interface software devices (<em>ib0</em> and <em>ib1</em>).

PCI link speed is also reported for some bridges and devices
because lstopo was privileged when it discovered the topology.

\page attributes Object attributes

\htmlonly
<div class="section" id="attributes_normal">
\endhtmlonly
\section attributes_normal Normal attributes

hwloc objects have many generic attributes in the ::hwloc_obj structure,
for instance their <tt>logical_index</tt> or <tt>os_index</tt>
(see \ref faq_indexes), <tt>depth</tt> or <tt>name</tt>.

The kind of object is first described by the <tt>obj->type</tt>
generic attribute (an integer).
OS devices also have a specific <tt>obj->attr->osdev.type</tt> integer
for distinguishing between NICs, GPUs, etc.
Objects may also have an optional <tt>obj->subtype</tt> pointing
to a better description string.
For instance subtype is useful to say what Group objects are actually
made of (e.g. <em>Book</em> for Linux S/390 books).
It may also specify that a Block OS device is a <em>Disk</em>,
or that a CoProcessor OS device is a <em>CUDA</em> device.
This subtype is displayed by lstopo either in place or after the
main <tt>obj->type</tt> attribute.

Each object also contains an <tt>attr</tt> field that, if non NULL,
points to a union ::hwloc_obj_attr_u of type-specific attribute
structures.
For instance, a L2Cache object <tt>obj</tt> contains cache-specific
information in <tt>obj->attr->cache</tt>, such as its size and
associativity, cache type.
See ::hwloc_obj_attr_u for details.


\htmlonly
</div><div class="section" id="attributes_info">
\endhtmlonly
\section attributes_info Custom string infos

Aside os these generic attribute fields, hwloc annotates
many objects with string attributes that are made of a key and a
value.
Each object contains a list of such pairs that may be consulted
manually (looking at the object <tt>infos</tt> array field)
or using the hwloc_obj_get_info_by_name().
The user may additionally add new key-value pairs to any object using
hwloc_obj_add_info() or the \ref cli_hwloc_annotate program.

Here is a non-exhaustive list of attributes that may be automatically
added by hwloc (with the usual corresponding object in parentheses).

\page xml Importing and exporting topologies from/to XML files

\htmlonly
<div class="section">
\endhtmlonly

hwloc offers the ability to export topologies to XML files and reload
them later. This is for instance useful for loading topologies faster
(see \ref faq_xml), manipulating other nodes' topology, or avoiding
the need for privileged processes (see \ref faq_privileged).

Topologies may be exported to XML files thanks to hwloc_topology_export_xml(),
or to a XML memory buffer with hwloc_topology_export_xmlbuffer().
The lstopo program can also serve as a XML topology export tool.

XML topologies may then be reloaded later with hwloc_topology_set_xml()
and hwloc_topology_set_xmlbuffer().
The HWLOC_XMLFILE environment variable also tells hwloc to load the topology
from the given XML file.

\note Loading XML topologies disables binding because the loaded
topology may not correspond to the physical machine that loads it.
This behavior may be reverted by asserting that loaded file really
matches the underlying system with the HWLOC_THISSYSTEM environment
variable or the ::HWLOC_TOPOLOGY_FLAG_IS_THISSYSTEM topology flag.

\note The topology flag ::HWLOC_TOPOLOGY_FLAG_THISSYSTEM_ALLOWED_RESOURCES
may be used to load a XML topology that contains the entire machine
and restrict it to the part that is actually available to the current
process (e.g. when Linux Cgroup/Cpuset are used to restrict the set
of resources).

\note hwloc also offers the ability to export/import \ref hwlocality_diff.

\note XML topology files are not localized. They use a dot as a
decimal separator. Therefore any exported topology can be
reloaded on any other machine without requiring to change the
locale.

\note XML exports contain all details about the platform. It means
that two very similar nodes still have different XML exports
(e.g. some serial numbers or MAC addresses are different).
If a less precise exporting/importing is required, one may want to
look at \ref synthetic instead.


\htmlonly
</div><div class="section" id="xml_backends">
\endhtmlonly
\section xml_backends libxml2 and minimalistic XML backends

hwloc offers two backends for importing/exporting XML.

First, it can use the libxml2 library for importing/exporting XML
files. It features full XML support, for instance when those files
have to be manipulated by non-hwloc software (e.g. a XSLT parser).
The libxml2 backend is enabled by default if libxml2 development
headers are available (the relevant development package is usually
<tt>libxml2-devel</tt> or <tt>libxml2-dev</tt>).

If libxml2 is not available at configure time,
or if <tt>\--disable-libxml2</tt> is passed, hwloc falls back to a
custom backend.
Contrary to the aforementioned full XML backend with libxml2, this
minimalistic XML backend cannot be guaranteed to work with external
programs.
It should only be assumed to be compatible with the same hwloc
release (even if using the libxml2 backend).
Its advantage is, however, to always be available without requiring
any external dependency.

If libxml2 is available but the core hwloc library should not directly
depend on it, the libxml2 support may be built as a dynamicall-loaded
plugin.
One should pass <tt>\--enable-plugins</tt> to enable plugin support
(when supported) and build as plugins all component that support it.
Or pass <tt>\--enable-plugins=xml_libxml</tt> to only build this
libxml2 support as a plugin.


\htmlonly
</div><div class="section" id="xml_errors">
\endhtmlonly
\section xml_errors XML import error management

Importing XML files can fail at least because of file access errors,
invalid XML syntax or non-hwloc-valid XML contents.

Both backend cannot detect all these errors when the input XML
file or buffer is selected (when hwloc_topology_set_xml() or
hwloc_topology_set_xmlbuffer() is called).
Some errors such non-hwloc-valid contents can only be detected
later when loading the topology with hwloc_topology_load().

It is therefore strongly recommended to check the return value of
both hwloc_topology_set_xml() (or hwloc_topology_set_xmlbuffer())
and hwloc_topology_load() to handle all these errors.




\page synthetic Synthetic topologies

\htmlonly
<div class="section">
\endhtmlonly

hwloc may load fake or remote topologies so as to consult them
without having the underlying hardware available.
Aside from loading XML topologies, hwloc also enables the building of
<em>synthetic</em> topologies that are described by a single string
listing the arity of each levels.

For instance, lstopo may create a topology made of 2 packages,
containing a single NUMA node and a L2 cache above two
single-threaded cores:

\verbatim
$ lstopo -i "pack:2 node:1 l2:1 core:2 pu:1" -
Machine (2048MB)
  Package L#0
    NUMANode L#0 (P#0 1024MB)
    L2 L#0 (4096KB)
      Core L#0 + PU L#0 (P#0)
      Core L#1 + PU L#1 (P#1)
  Package L#1
    NUMANode L#1 (P#1 1024MB)
    L2 L#1 (4096KB)
      Core L#2 + PU L#2 (P#2)
      Core L#3 + PU L#3 (P#3)
\endverbatim

Replacing <tt>-</tt> with <tt>file.xml</tt> in this command line
will export this topology to XML as usual.

\note Synthetic topologies offer a very basic way to export a
topology and reimport it on another machine. It is a lot less
precise than XML but may still be enough when only the hierarchy
of resources matters.


\htmlonly
</div><div class="section" id="synthetic_string">
\endhtmlonly
\section synthetic_string Synthetic description string

Each item in the description string gives the type of the level and
the number of such children under each object of the previous level.
That is why the above topology contains 4 cores (2 cores times 2 nodes).

These type names must be written as
<tt>numanode</tt>, <tt>package</tt>, <tt>core</tt>,
<tt>l2u</tt>, <tt>l1i</tt>, <tt>pu</tt>, <tt>group</tt>
(hwloc_obj_type_sscanf() is used for parsing the type names).
They do not need to be written case-sensitively, nor entirely
(as long as there is no ambiguity, 2 characters such as <tt>ma</tt>
 select a Machine level).
Note that I/O and Misc objects are not available.

Instead of specifying the type of each level, it is possible to
just specify the arities and let hwloc choose all types
according to usual topologies. The following examples are therefore
equivalent:
\verbatim
$ lstopo -i "2 3 4 5 6"
$ lstopo -i "Package:2 NUMANode:3 L2Cache:4 Core:5 PU:6"
\endverbatim

NUMA nodes are handled in a special way since they are not part of the
main CPU hierarchy but rather attached below it as memory children.
Thus, <tt>NUMANode:3</tt> actually means <tt>Group:3</tt> where one
NUMA node is attached below each group.
These groups are merged back into the parent when possible
(typically when a single NUMA node is requested below each parent).

It is also possible the explicitly attach NUMA nodes to specific levels.
For instance, a KNL-like topology with 2 NUMA nodes per 16-core group
may be created with:
\verbatim
$ lstopo -i "package:1 group:4 [numa] [numa] core:16 pu:4"
\endverbatim

The root object does not appear in the synthetic description string
since it is always a Machine object.
Therefore the Machine type is disallowed in the description as well.

A NUMA level (with a single NUMA node) is automatically added if needed.

Each item may be followed parentheses containing a list of
space-separated attributes. For instance:
<ul>
<li>
 <tt>L2iCache:2(size=32kB)</tt> specifies 2 children
 of 32kB level-2 instruction caches.
 The size may be specified in bytes (without any unit suffix) or as TB, GB, MB or kB.
</li>
<li>
 <tt>NUMANode:3(memory=16MB)</tt> specifies 3 NUMA nodes with 16MB each.
 The size may be specified in bytes (without any unit suffix) or as TB, GB, MB or kB.
</li>
<li>
 <tt>PU:2(indexes=0,2,1,3)</tt> specifies 2 PU children and the
 full list of OS indexes among the entire set of 4 PU objects.
</li>
<li>
 <tt>PU:2(indexes=numa:core)</tt> specifies 2 PU children whose
 OS indexes are interleaved by NUMA node first and then by package.
</li>
<li>
 Attributes in parentheses at the very beginning of the description
 apply to the root object.
</li>
</ul>

\section synthetic_use Loading a synthetic topology

Aside from lstopo, the hwloc programming interface offers the same
ability by passing the synthetic description string to
hwloc_topology_set_synthetic() before hwloc_topology_load().

Synthetic topologies are created by the <tt>synthetic</tt> component.
This component may be enabled by force by setting the HWLOC_SYNTHETIC
environment variable to something such as
<tt>node:2 core:3 pu:4</tt>.

Loading a synthetic topology disables binding support since the
topology usually does not match the underlying hardware.
Binding may be reenabled as usual by setting HWLOC_THISSYSTEM=1 in the
environment or by setting the ::HWLOC_TOPOLOGY_FLAG_IS_THISSYSTEM
topology flag.

\section synthetic_export Exporting a topology as a synthetic string

The function hwloc_topology_export_synthetic() may export
a topology as a synthetic string.
It offers a convenient way to quickly describe the contents of a machine.
The lstopo tool may also perform such an export by forcing the output format.

\verbatim
$ lstopo --of synthetic --no-io
Package:1 L3Cache:1 L2Cache:2 L1dCache:1 L1iCache:1 Core:1 PU:2
\endverbatim

The exported string may be passed back to hwloc for recreating
another similar topology.
The entire tree will be similar, but some attributes such as
the processor model will be missing.

Such an export is only possible if the topology is totally symmetric.
It means that the <tt>symmetric_subtree</tt> field of the root object
is set.
Also memory children should be attached in a symmetric way
(e.g. the same number of memory children below each Package object, etc.).
However, I/O devices and Misc objects are ignored when looking at
symmetry and exporting the string.




\page interoperability Interoperability With Other Software

\htmlonly
<div class="section">
\endhtmlonly

Although hwloc offers its own portable interface, it still may have to
interoperate with specific or non-portable libraries that manipulate
similar kinds of objects.  hwloc therefore offers several specific
"helpers" to assist converting between those specific interfaces and
hwloc.

Some external libraries may be specific to a particular OS; others may
not always be available.  The hwloc core therefore generally does not
explicitly depend on these types of libraries.  However, when a custom
application uses or otherwise depends on such a library, it may
optionally include the corresponding hwloc helper to extend the hwloc
interface with dedicated helpers.

Most of these helpers use structures that are specific to these external
libraries and only meaningful on the local machine. If so, the helper
requires the input topology to match the current machine.
Some helpers also require I/O device discovery to be supported and
enabled for the current topology.

  option to manipulate taskset-specific strings.

\page threadsafety Thread Safety

\htmlonly
<div class="section">
\endhtmlonly

Like most libraries that mainly fill data structures, hwloc is not
thread safe but rather reentrant: all state is held in a
::hwloc_topology_t instance without mutex protection.  That means, for
example, that two threads can safely operate on and modify two
different ::hwloc_topology_t instances, but they should not
simultaneously invoke functions that modify the <em>same</em>
instance.  Similarly, one thread should not modify a
::hwloc_topology_t instance while another thread is reading or
traversing it.  However, two threads can safely read or traverse the
same ::hwloc_topology_t instance concurrently.

When running in multiprocessor environments, be aware that proper thread
synchronization and/or memory coherency protection is needed to pass hwloc
data (such as ::hwloc_topology_t pointers) from one processor
to another (e.g., a mutex, semaphore, or a memory barrier).
Note that this is not a hwloc-specific requirement, but it is worth
mentioning.

For reference, ::hwloc_topology_t modification operations include
(but may not be limited to):

<dl>

<dt>Creation and destruction</dt>
  <dd><tt>hwloc_topology_init(), hwloc_topology_load(),
  hwloc_topology_destroy()</tt> (see \ref hwlocality_creation) imply
  major modifications of the structure, including freeing some
  objects.  No other thread cannot access the topology or any of its
  objects at the same time.

  Also references to objects inside the topology are not valid anymore
  after these functions return.  </dd>

<dt>Runtime topology modifications</dt>
  <dd><tt>hwloc_topology_insert_misc_object()</tt>,
  <tt>hwloc_topology_alloc_group_object()</tt>,
  and <tt>hwloc_topology_insert_group_object()</tt>
  (see \ref hwlocality_tinker) may modify the topology significantly by adding
  objects inside the tree, changing the topology depth, etc.

  <tt>hwloc_distances_add()</tt> and <tt>hwloc_distances_remove()</tt>
  (see \ref hwlocality_distances_add) modify the list of distance structures
  in the topology, and the former may even insert new Group objects.

  <tt>hwloc_topology_restrict()</tt> modifies the topology even more
  dramatically by removing some objects.

  Although references to former objects <em>may</em> still be valid
  after insertion or restriction, it is strongly advised to not rely on any such
  guarantee and always re-consult the topology to reacquire new
  instances of objects.  </dd>

<dt>Consulting distances</dt>
  <dd>

\page plugins Components and plugins

\htmlonly
<div class="section">
\endhtmlonly

hwloc is organized in components that are responsible for discovering
objects.
Depending on the topology configuration, some components will be used,
some will be ignored.
The usual default is to enable the native operating system component,
(e.g. <tt>linux</tt> or <tt>solaris</tt>) and the
<tt>pci</tt> miscellaneous component.
If available, an architecture-specific component (such as <tt>x86</tt>)
may also improve the topology detection.

If a XML topology is loaded, the <tt>xml</tt> discovery  component
will be used instead of all other components.
It internally uses a specific class of components for the actual XML
import/export routines (<tt>xml_libxml</tt> and <tt>xml_nolibxml</tt>)
but these will not be discussed here (see \ref xml_backends).


\htmlonly
</div><div class="section" id="plugins_default">
\endhtmlonly
\section plugins_default Components enabled by default

The hwloc core contains a list of components sorted by priority.
Each one is enabled as long as it does not conflict with the
previously enabled ones.
This includes native operating system components,
architecture-specific ones, and if available, I/O components
such as <tt>pci</tt>.

Usually the native operating system component
(when it exists, e.g. <tt>linux</tt> or <tt>aix</tt>)
is enabled first.
Then hwloc looks for an architecture specific component
(e.g. <tt>x86</tt>).
Finally there also exist a basic component (<tt>no_os</tt>)
that just tries to discover the number of PUs in the system.

Each component discovers as much topology information as possible.
Most of them, including most native OS components, do nothing
unless the topology is still empty.
Some others, such as <tt>x86</tt> and <tt>pci</tt>,
can complete and annotate what other backends found earlier.

Default priorities ensure that clever components are invoked first.
Native operating system components have higher priorities,
and are therefore invoked first, because they likely offer
very detailed topology information.
If needed, it will be later extended by architecture-specific
information (e.g. from the <tt>x86</tt> component).

If any configuration function such as hwloc_topology_set_xml()
is used before loading the topology, the corresponding component
is enabled first.
Then, as usual, hwloc enables any other component (based on
priorities) that does not conflict.

Certain components that manage a virtual topology, for instance XML
topology import or synthetic topology description,
conflict with all other components.
Therefore, one of them may only be loaded
(e.g. with <tt>hwloc_topology_set_xml()</tt>)
if no other component is enabled.

The environment variable <tt>HWLOC_COMPONENTS_VERBOSE</tt>
may be set to get verbose messages about component registration
(including their priority) and enabling.


\htmlonly
</div><div class="section" id="plugins_select">
\endhtmlonly
\section plugins_select Selecting which components to use

If no topology configuration functions such as
<tt>hwloc_topology_set_synthetic()</tt> have been called,
plugins may be selected with environment variables such as
<tt>HWLOC_XMLFILE</tt>, <tt>HWLOC_SYNTHETIC</tt> or
<tt>HWLOC_FSROOT</tt> (see \ref envvar).

Finally, the environment variable <tt>HWLOC_COMPONENTS</tt>
resets the list of selected components.
If the variable is set and empty (or set to a single comma separating nothing,
since some operating systems do not accept empty variables),
the normal plugin priority order is used.

If the variable is set to <tt>x86</tt> in this variable will cause
the <tt>x86</tt> component to take precedence over any other component,
including the native operating system component.
It is therefore loaded first, before hwloc tries to load all remaining
non-conflicting components.
In this case, <tt>x86</tt> would take care of discovering everything
it supports, instead of only completing what the native OS information.
This may be useful if the native component is buggy on some platforms.

It is possible to prevent some components from being loaded by prefixing their
name with <tt>-</tt> in the list. For instance <tt>x86,-pci</tt> will load the
<tt>x86</tt> component, then let hwloc load all the usual components except
<tt>pci</tt>.

It is possible to prevent all remaining components from being loaded
by placing <tt>stop</tt> in the environment variable.
Only the components listed before this keyword will be enabled.


\htmlonly
</div><div class="section" id="plugins_load">
\endhtmlonly
\section plugins_load Loading components from plugins

Components may optionally be built as plugins so that the hwloc core
library does not directly depend on their dependencies (for instance
the <tt>libpciaccess</tt> library).
Plugin support may be enabled with the <tt>\--enable-plugins</tt>
configure option.
All components buildable as plugins will then be built as plugins.
The configure option may be given a comma-separated list of component
names to specify the exact list of components to build as plugins.

Plugins are built as independent dynamic libraries that are installed
in <tt>$libdir/hwloc</tt>.
All plugins found in this directory are loaded during
<tt>topology_init()</tt>
(unless blacklisted in <tt>HWLOC_PLUGINS_BLACKLIST</tt>, see \ref envvar).
A specific list of directories (colon-separated) to scan may be
specified in the <tt>HWLOC_PLUGINS_PATH</tt> environment variable.

Note that loading a plugin just means that the corresponding component
is registered to the hwloc core.
Components are then only enabled if the topology configuration
requests it, as explained in the previous sections.

Also note that plugins should carefully be enabled and used when
embedding hwloc in another project, see \ref embed for details.


\htmlonly
</div><div class="section" id="plugins_add">

\section plugins_adding Adding new discovery components and plugins

The types and functions cited below are declared in the hwloc/plugins.h header.
Components are supposed to only use hwloc public headers (hwloc.h and
anything under the <tt>include/hwloc</tt> subdirectory) and nothing from the
<tt>include/private</tt> subdirectory in the source tree.

\subsection plugins_disc_basic Basics of discovery components

Each discovery component is defined by a <tt>::hwloc_disc_component</tt>
structure which contains an <tt>instantiate()</tt> callback.
This function is invoked when this component is actually used by a topology.
It fills a new <tt>::hwloc_backend</tt> structure that usually contains
a <tt>discover()</tt> callback taking care of the actual topology discovery.

\note If two discovery components have the same name, only the highest
priority one is actually made available.
This offers a way for third-party plugins to override existing components.

\subsection plugins_disc_register Registering a new discovery component

Registering components to the hwloc core relies on a <tt>::hwloc_component</tt> structure.
Its <tt>data</tt> field points to the previously defined <tt>::hwloc_disc_component</tt>
structure while its <tt>type</tt> should be ::HWLOC_COMPONENT_TYPE_DISC.
This structure should be named <tt>hwloc_&lt;name&gt;_component</tt>.

The configure script should be modified to add <tt>&lt;name&gt;</tt>
to its <tt>hwloc_components</tt> shell variable so that the component
is actually available.

\note The symbol name of the <tt>::hwloc_component</tt> structure
is independent of the name of the discovery component mentioned
in the previous section.

When the component is statically built inside the hwloc library,
the symbol <tt>hwloc_&lt;name&gt;_component</tt> is added by configure
to the <tt>src/static-components.h</tt>.
The core then registers all components listed in this file.

If the new component may be built as a plugin, the configure script
should also define the shell variable
<tt>hwloc_&lt;name&gt;_component_maybeplugin=1</tt>.
When the configure script actually enables the component as a plugin,
it will set the variable <tt>hwloc_&lt;name&gt;_component</tt>
to <tt>plugin</tt>.
The build system may then use this variable to change the way the component is built.
It should create a <tt>hwloc_&lt;name&gt;.so</tt> shared object.
All these files are loaded in alphabetic order, and the components
they contain are registered to the hwloc core.

\page embed Embedding hwloc in Other Software

\htmlonly
<div class="section">
\endhtmlonly

It can be desirable to include hwloc in a larger software package (be
sure to check out the LICENSE file) so that users don't have to
separately download and install it before installing your software.
This can be advantageous to ensure that your software uses a
known-tested/good version of hwloc, or for use on systems that do not
have hwloc pre-installed.

When used in "embedded" mode, hwloc will:

- not install any header files
- not build any documentation files
- not build or install any executables or tests
- not build <tt>libhwloc.*</tt> -- instead, it will build
  <tt>libhwloc_embedded.*</tt>

There are two ways to put hwloc into "embedded" mode.  The first is
directly from the configure command line:

\verbatim
shell$ ./configure --enable-embedded-mode ...
\endverbatim

The second requires that your software project uses the GNU Autoconf /
Automake / Libtool tool chain to build your software.  If you do this,
you can directly integrate hwloc's m4 configure macro into your
configure script.  You can then invoke hwloc's configuration tests and
build setup by calling an m4 macro (see below).

Although hwloc dynamic shared object plugins may be used in embedded
mode, the embedder project will have to manually setup libltdl in its
build system so that hwloc can load its plugins at run time.
Also, embedders should be aware of complications that can arise due to
public and private linker namespaces (e.g., if the embedder project is
loaded into a private namespace and then hwloc tries to dynamically
load its plugins, such loading may fail since the hwloc plugins can't
find the hwloc symbols they need).
The embedder project is <b>strongly</b> advised not to use hwloc's
dynamically loading plugins / libltdl capability.


\htmlonly
</div><div class="section" id="embedding_m4">
\endhtmlonly
\section embedding_m4 Using hwloc's M4 Embedding Capabilities

Every project is different, and there are many different ways of
integrating hwloc into yours.  What follows is <em>one</em> example of
how to do it.

If your project uses recent versions Autoconf, Automake, and Libtool
to build, you can use hwloc's embedded m4 capabilities.  We have
tested the embedded m4 with projects that use Autoconf 2.65, Automake
1.11.1, and Libtool 2.2.6b.  Slightly earlier versions of may also
work but are untested.  Autoconf versions prior to 2.65 are almost
certain to not work.

You can either copy all the config/hwloc*m4 files from the hwloc
source tree to the directory where your project's m4 files reside, or
you can tell aclocal to find more m4 files in the embedded hwloc's
"config" subdirectory (e.g., add "-Ipath/to/embedded/hwloc/config" to
your Makefile.am's ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS).

The following macros can then be used from your configure script (only
HWLOC_SETUP_CORE <em>must</em> be invoked if using the m4 macros):

- HWLOC_SETUP_CORE(config-dir-prefix, action-upon-success,
  action-upon-failure, print_banner_or_not): Invoke the hwloc
  configuration tests and setup the hwloc tree to build.  The first
  argument is the prefix to use for AC_OUTPUT files -- it's where the
  hwloc tree is located relative to <tt>$top_srcdir</tt>.  Hence, if
  your embedded hwloc is located in the source tree at contrib/hwloc,
  you should pass <tt>[contrib/hwloc]</tt> as the first argument.  If
  HWLOC_SETUP_CORE and the rest of <tt>configure</tt> completes
  successfully, then "make" traversals of the hwloc tree with standard
  Automake targets (all, clean, install, etc.) should behave as
  expected.  For example, it is safe to list the hwloc directory in
  the SUBDIRS of a higher-level Makefile.am.  The last argument, if
  not empty, will cause the macro to display an announcement banner
  that it is starting the hwloc core configuration tests.

  HWLOC_SETUP_CORE will set the following environment variables and
  AC_SUBST them: HWLOC_EMBEDDED_CFLAGS, HWLOC_EMBEDDED_CPPFLAGS, and
  HWLOC_EMBEDDED_LIBS.  These flags are filled with the values
  discovered in the hwloc-specific m4 tests, and can be used in your
  build process as relevant.  The _CFLAGS, _CPPFLAGS, and _LIBS
  variables are necessary to build libhwloc (or libhwloc_embedded)
  itself.  

  HWLOC_SETUP_CORE also sets HWLOC_EMBEDDED_LDADD environment variable
  (and AC_SUBSTs it) to contain the location of the
  libhwloc_embedded.la convenience Libtool archive.  It can be used in
  your build process to link an application or other library against
  the embedded hwloc library.

  <strong>NOTE: If the HWLOC_SET_SYMBOL_PREFIX macro is used, it must
  be invoked <em>before</em> HWLOC_SETUP_CORE.</strong>

- HWLOC_BUILD_STANDALONE: HWLOC_SETUP_CORE defaults to building hwloc
  in an "embedded" mode (described above).  If HWLOC_BUILD_STANDALONE
  is invoked *before* HWLOC_SETUP_CORE, the embedded definitions will
  not apply (e.g., libhwloc.la will be built, not
  libhwloc_embedded.la).

- HWLOC_SET_SYMBOL_PREFIX(foo_): Tells the hwloc to prefix all of
  hwloc's types and public symbols with "foo_"; meaning that function
  hwloc_init() becomes foo_hwloc_init().  Enum values are prefixed
  with an upper-case translation if the prefix supplied;
  HWLOC_OBJ_CORE becomes FOO_HWLOC_OBJ_CORE.  This is recommended
  behavior if you are including hwloc in middleware -- it is possible
  that your software will be combined with other software that links
  to another copy of hwloc.  If both uses of hwloc utilize different
  symbol prefixes, there will be no type/symbol clashes, and
  everything will compile, link, and run successfully.  If you both
  embed hwloc without changing the symbol prefix and also link against
  an external hwloc, you may get multiple symbol definitions when
  linking your final library or application.

- HWLOC_SETUP_DOCS, HWLOC_SETUP_UTILS, HWLOC_SETUP_TESTS: These three
  macros only apply when hwloc is built in "standalone" mode (i.e.,
  they should NOT be invoked unless HWLOC_BUILD_STANDALONE has already
  been invoked).

- HWLOC_DO_AM_CONDITIONALS: If you embed hwloc in a larger project and
  build it conditionally with Automake (e.g., if HWLOC_SETUP_CORE is
  invoked conditionally), you must unconditionally invoke
  HWLOC_DO_AM_CONDITIONALS to avoid warnings from Automake (for the
  cases where hwloc is not selected to be built).  This macro is
  necessary because hwloc uses some AM_CONDITIONALs to build itself,
  and AM_CONDITIONALs cannot be defined conditionally.  Note that it
  is safe (but unnecessary) to call HWLOC_DO_AM_CONDITIONALS even if
  HWLOC_SETUP_CORE is invoked unconditionally.  If you are not using
  Automake to build hwloc, this macro is unnecessary (and will actually
  cause errors because it invoked AM_* macros that will be undefined).

<strong>NOTE:</strong> When using the HWLOC_SETUP_CORE m4 macro, it may
be necessary to explicitly invoke AC_CANONICAL_TARGET (which requires
config.sub and config.guess) and/or AC_USE_SYSTEM_EXTENSIONS macros
early in the configure script (e.g., after AC_INIT but before
AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE).  See the Autoconf documentation for further
information.

Also note that hwloc's top-level configure.ac script uses exactly the
macros described above to build hwloc in a standalone mode (by
default).  You may want to examine it for one example of how these
macros are used.

  1. Add "-Imy-embedded-hwloc/config" to ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS
  2. Add "my-embedded-hwloc" to SUBDIRS
  3. Add "$(HWLOC_EMBEDDED_LDADD)" and "$(HWLOC_EMBEDDED_LIBS)" to 
     sandbox's executable's LDADD line.  The former is the name of the 
     Libtool convenience library that hwloc will generate.  The latter 
     is any dependent support libraries that may be needed by 
     $(HWLOC_EMBEDDED_LDADD).
  4. Add "$(HWLOC_EMBEDDED_CFLAGS)" to AM_CFLAGS
  5. Add "$(HWLOC_EMBEDDED_CPPFLAGS)" to AM_CPPFLAGS
shell$ edit configure.ac
  1. Add "HWLOC_SET_SYMBOL_PREFIX(sandbox_hwloc_)" line
  2. Add "HWLOC_SETUP_CORE([my-embedded-hwloc], [happy=yes], [happy=no])" line
  3. Add error checking for happy=no case
shell$ edit sandbox.c
  1. Add #include <hwloc.h>
  2. Add calls to sandbox_hwloc_init() and other hwloc API functions
\endverbatim

Now you can bootstrap, configure, build, and run the sandbox as normal
-- all calls to "sandbox_hwloc_*" will use the embedded hwloc rather
than any system-provided copy of hwloc.

\section faq1 Concepts


\subsection faq_why I only need binding, why should I use hwloc ?

hwloc is its portable API that works on a variety of operating
systems.
It supports binding of threads, processes and memory buffers
(see \ref hwlocality_cpubinding and \ref hwlocality_membinding).
Even if some features are not supported on some systems,
using hwloc is much easier than reimplementing your own portability layer.

Moreover, hwloc provides knowledge of cores and hardware threads.
It offers easy ways to bind tasks to individual hardware threads,
or to entire multithreaded cores, etc.
See \ref faq_smt.
Most alternative software for binding do not even know whether each
core is single-threaded, multithreaded or hyper-threaded.
They would bind to individual threads without any way to know whether
multiple tasks are in the same physical core.

However, using hwloc comes with an overhead since a topology must
be loaded before gathering information and binding tasks or memory.
Fortunately this overhead may be significantly reduced by filtering
non-interesting information out of the topology.
For instance the following code builds a topology that only contains
Cores, hardware threads (PUs, cannot be filtered-out),
and NUMA nodes (cannot be filtered-out).

\verbatim
hwloc_topology_t topology;
hwloc_topology_init(&topology);
hwloc_topology_set_all_types_filter(topology, HWLOC_TYPE_FILTER_KEEP_NONE);
hwloc_topology_set_type_filter(topology, HWLOC_OBJ_CORE, HWLOC_TYPE_FILTER_KEEP_ALL);
hwloc_topology_load(topology);
\endverbatim

However, one should remember that filtering such objects out removes
locality information from the hwloc tree.
For instance, we do not know anymore which PU is close to which NUMA
node.
This would be useful to applications that explicitly want to
place specific memory buffers close to specific tasks.
Those applications just need to tell hwloc to keep Group objects that
bring structure information:
\verbatim
hwloc_topology_set_type_filter(topology, HWLOC_OBJ_GROUP, HWLOC_TYPE_FILTER_KEEP_STRUCTURE);
\endverbatim

Note that the default configuration is to keep all objects enabled,
except I/Os and instruction caches.


\subsection faq_indexes Should I use logical or physical/OS indexes? and how?

One of the original reasons why hwloc was created is that <b>physical/OS indexes</b>
(<tt>obj->os_index</tt>) are often crazy and unpredictable:
logical processors numbers are usually
non-contiguous (processors 0 and 1 are not physically close), they vary from
one machine to another, and may even change after a BIOS or system update.
This numbers make task placement hardly portable.
Moreover some objects have no physical/OS numbers (caches), and some objects
have non-unique numbers (core numbers are only unique within a socket).
Physical/OS indexes are only guaranteed to exist and be unique for PU
and NUMA nodes.

hwloc therefore introduces <b>logical indexes</b> (<tt>obj->logical_index</tt>)
which are portable, contiguous and logically ordered
(based on the resource organization in the locality tree).
In general, one should only use logical indexes and just let hwloc do the
internal conversion when really needed (when talking to the OS and hardware).

hwloc developers recommends that users do not use physical/OS indexes
unless they really know what they are doing.
The main reason for still using physical/OS indexes is when interacting with
non-hwloc tools such as numactl or taskset, or when reading hardware information
from raw sources such as /proc/cpuinfo.

lstopo options <tt>-l</tt> and <tt>-p</tt> may be used to switch between
logical indexes (prefixed with <tt>L#</tt>) and physical/OS indexes (<tt>P#</tt>).
Converting one into the other may also be achieved with hwloc-calc which may
manipulate either logical or physical indexes as input or output.
See also \ref cli_hwloc_calc.

\verbatim
# Convert PU with physical number 3 into logical number
$ hwloc-calc -I pu --physical-input --logical-output pu:3
5

# Convert a set of NUMA nodes from logical to physical
# (beware that the output order may not match the input order)
$ hwloc-calc -I numa --logical-input --physical-output numa:2-3 numa:7
0,2,5
\endverbatim


\subsection faq_structural hwloc is only a structural model, it ignores performance models, memory bandwidth, etc.?

hwloc is indeed designed to provide applications with a structural model
of the platform. This is an orthogonal approach to describing the
machine with performance models, for instance using memory bandwidth
or latencies measured by benchmarks.
We believe that both approaches are important for helping application
make the most of the hardware.

For instance, on a dual-processor host with four cores each, hwloc
clearly shows which four cores are together.
Latencies between all pairs of cores of the same processor are likely
identical, and also likely lower than the latency between cores of
different processors.
However, the structural model cannot guarantee such implementation
details.
On the other side, performance models would reveal such details
without always clearly identifying which cores are in the same
processor.

The focus of hwloc is mainly of the structural modeling side.
However, hwloc lets user adds performance information to the topology
through distances
(see \ref hwlocality_distances_get and \ref hwlocality_distances_add)
or even custom annotations (see \ref faq_annotate).
hwloc may also use such distance information for grouping objects
together (see \ref faq_onedim and \ref faq_groups).


\subsection faq_onedim hwloc only has a one-dimensional view of the architecture, it ignores distances?

hwloc places all objects in a tree. Each level is a one-dimensional
view of a set of similar objects. All children of the same object (siblings)
are assumed to be equally interconnected (same distance between any of them),
while the distance between children of different objects (cousins) is supposed
to be larger.

Modern machines exhibit complex hardware interconnects, so this tree
may miss some information about the actual physical distances between objects.
The hwloc topology may therefore be annotated with distance information that
may be used to build a more realistic representation (multi-dimensional)
of each level.
For instance, there can be a distance matrix that representing the latencies
between any pair of NUMA nodes if the BIOS and/or operating system reports them.

For more information about the distance API, see \ref
hwlocality_distances_get and \ref hwlocality_distances_add.


\subsection faq_groups What are these Group objects in my topology?

hwloc comes with a set of predefined object types (Core, Package, NUMA node, Caches)
that match the vast majority of hardware platforms.
The ::HWLOC_OBJ_GROUP type was designed for cases where this set is not sufficient.
Groups may be used anywhere to add more structure information to the topology,
for instance to show that 2 out of 4 NUMA nodes are actually closer than the others.
When applicable, the <tt>subtype</tt> field describes why a Group
was actually added (see also \ref attributes_normal).

hwloc currently uses Groups for the following reasons:
<ul>
<li>NUMA parents when memory locality does not match any existing object.</li>
<li>I/O parents when I/O locality does not match any existing object.</li>
<li>Distance-based groups made of close objects.</li>
<li>AMD dual-core compute units (<tt>subtype</tt> is <tt>ComputeUnit</tt>, in the x86 backend),
 but these objects are usually merged with the L2 caches.</li>
<li>Intel x2APIC non-core and non-package levels (in the x86 backend).</li>
<li>Windows processor groups (unless they contain a single NUMA node, or a single Package, etc.).</li>
<li>IBM S/390 "Books" on Linux (<tt>subtype</tt> is <tt>Book</tt>).</li>
<li>AIX unknown hierarchy levels.</li>
</ul>

hwloc Groups are only kept if no other object has the same
locality information.
It means that a Group containing a single child is merged
into that child.
And a Group is merged into its parent if it is its only child.
For instance a Windows processor group containing a single NUMA node
would be  merged with that NUMA node since it already contains the
relevant hierarchy information.


\subsection faq_asymmetric What happens if my topology is asymmetric?

hwloc supports asymmetric topologies even if most platforms are usually
symmetric. For example, there could be different types of processors
in a single machine, each with different numbers of cores, symmetric
multithreading, or levels of caches.

In practice, asymmetric topologies mostly appear when intermediate groups
are added for I/O affinity: on a 4-package machine, an I/O bus may be
connected to 2 packages. These packages are below an additional Group
object, while the other packages are not (see also \ref faq_groups).

To understand how hwloc manages such cases, one should first remember
the meaning of levels and cousin objects. All objects of the same type
are gathered as horizontal levels with a given depth. They are also
connected through the cousin pointers of the ::hwloc_obj structure.
Object attribute (cache depth and type, group depth) are also taken
in account when gathering objects as horizontal levels.
To be clear: there will be one level for L1i
caches, another level for L1d caches, another one for L2, etc.

If the topology is asymmetric (e.g., if a group is missing above some
processors), a given horizontal level will still exist if there
exist any objects of that type.  However, some branches of the overall
tree may not have an object located in that horizontal level.  Note
that this specific hole within one horizontal level does not imply
anything for other levels.  All objects of the same type are gathered
in horizontal levels even if their parents or children have different
depths and types.

See the diagram in \ref termsanddefs for a graphical representation
of such topologies.

Moreover, it is important to understand that a same parent object may
have children of different types (and therefore, different
depths). <strong>These children are therefore siblings (because they
have the same parent), but they are <em>not</em> cousins (because they
do not belong to the same horizontal level).</strong>


\subsection faq_nosmt What happens to my topology if I disable symmetric multithreading, hyper-threading, etc. in the system?

hwloc creates one PU (processing unit) object per hardware thread.
If your machine supports symmetric multithreading, for instance Hyper-Threading,
each Core object may contain multiple PU objects:
\verbatim
$ lstopo -
...
  Core L#0
    PU L#0 (P#0)
    PU L#1 (P#2)
  Core L#1
    PU L#2 (P#1)
    PU L#3 (P#3)
\endverbatim

x86 machines usually offer the ability to disable hyper-threading in the BIOS.
Or it can be disabled on the Linux kernel command-line at boot time,
or later by writing in sysfs virtual files.

If you do so, the hwloc topology structure does not significantly change,
but some PU objects will not appear anymore.
No level will disappear, you will see the same number of Core objects,
but each of them will contain a single PU now.
The PU level does not disappear either
(remember that hwloc topologies always contain a PU level at the bottom of the topology)
even if there is a single PU object per Core parent.
\verbatim
$ lstopo -
...
  Core L#0
    PU L#0 (P#0)
  Core L#1
    PU L#1 (P#1)
\endverbatim


\subsection faq_smt How may I ignore symmetric multithreading, hyper-threading, etc. in hwloc?

First, see \ref faq_nosmt for more information about multithreading.

If you need to ignore symmetric multithreading in software,
you should likely manipulate hwloc Core objects directly:
\verbatim
/* get the number of cores */
unsigned nbcores = hwloc_get_nbobjs_by_type(topology, HWLOC_OBJ_CORE);
...
/* get the third core below the first package */
hwloc_obj_t package, core;
package = hwloc_get_obj_by_type(topology, HWLOC_OBJ_PACKAGE, 0);
core = hwloc_get_obj_inside_cpuset_by_type(topology, package->cpuset,
                                           HWLOC_OBJ_CORE, 2);
\endverbatim

Whenever you want to bind a process or thread to a core, make sure you
singlify its cpuset first, so that the task is actually bound to a single
thread within this core (to avoid useless migrations).
\verbatim
/* bind on the second core */
hwloc_obj_t core = hwloc_get_obj_by_type(topology, HWLOC_OBJ_CORE, 1);
hwloc_cpuset_t set = hwloc_bitmap_dup(core->cpuset);
hwloc_bitmap_singlify(set);
hwloc_set_cpubind(topology, set, 0);
hwloc_bitmap_free(set);
\endverbatim

With hwloc-calc or hwloc-bind command-line tools, you may specify that
you only want a single-thread within each core by asking for their first
PU object:
\verbatim
$ hwloc-calc core:4-7
0x0000ff00
$ hwloc-calc core:4-7.pu:0
0x00005500
\endverbatim

When binding a process on the command-line, you may either specify
the exact thread that you want to use, or ask hwloc-bind to singlify
the cpuset before binding
\verbatim
$ hwloc-bind core:3.pu:0 -- echo "hello from first thread on core #3"
hello from first thread on core #3
...
$ hwloc-bind core:3 --single -- echo "hello from a single thread on core #3"
hello from a single thread on core #3
\endverbatim

\subsection faq_xml I do not want hwloc to rediscover my enormous machine topology every time I rerun a process

Although the topology discovery is not expensive on common machines,
its overhead may become significant when multiple processes repeat
the discovery on large machines (for instance when starting one process
per core in a parallel application).
The machine topology usually does not vary much, except if some cores
are stopped/restarted or if the administrator restrictions are modified.
Thus rediscovering the whole topology again and again may look useless.

For this purpose, hwloc offers XML import/export and shared memory features.

XML lets you
save the discovered topology to a file (for instance with the lstopo program)
and reload it later by setting the HWLOC_XMLFILE environment variable.
The HWLOC_THISSYSTEM environment variable should also be set to 1 to
assert that loaded file is really the underlying system.

Loading a XML topology is usually much faster than querying multiple
files or calling multiple functions of the operating system.
It is also possible to manipulate such XML files with the C programming
interface, and the import/export may also be directed to memory buffer
(that may for instance be transmitted between applications through a package).
See also \ref xml.

\note The environment variable HWLOC_THISSYSTEM_ALLOWED_RESOURCES
may be used to load a XML topology that contains the entire machine
and restrict it to the part that is actually available to the current
process (e.g. when Linux Cgroup/Cpuset are used to restrict the set
of resources). See \ref envvar.

Shared-memory topologies consist in one process exposing its topology
in a shared-memory buffer so that other processes (running on the same machine)
may use it directly.
This has the advantage of reducing the memory footprint since a single
topology is stored in physical memory for multiple processes.
However, it requires all processes to map this shared-memory buffer
at the same virtual address, which may be difficult in some cases.
This API is described in \ref hwlocality_shmem.


\subsection faq_multitopo How many topologies may I use in my program?

hwloc lets you manipulate multiple topologies at the same time.
However, these topologies consume memory and system resources
(for instance file descriptors) until they are destroyed.
It is therefore discouraged to open the same topology multiple
times.

Sharing a single topology between threads is easy (see \ref threadsafety)
since the vast majority of accesses are read-only.

If multiple topologies of different (but similar) nodes are needed
in your program, have a look at \ref faq_diff.


\subsection faq_diff How to avoid memory waste when manipulating multiple similar topologies?

hwloc does not share information between topologies.
If multiple similar topologies are loaded in memory, for instance
the topologies of different identical nodes of a cluster,
lots of information will be duplicated.

hwloc/diff.h (see also \ref hwlocality_diff) offers the ability to
compute topology differences, apply or unapply them, or export/import
to/from XML.
However, this feature is limited to basic differences such as attribute changes.
It does not support complex modifications such as adding or removing some objects.


\subsection faq_annotate How do I annotate the topology with private notes?

Each hwloc object contains a <tt>userdata</tt> field that may be used by
applications to store private pointers. This field is only valid
during the lifetime of these container object and topology.
It becomes invalid as soon the topology is destroyed,
or as soon as the object disappears, for instance when restricting
the topology.
The userdata field is not exported/imported to/from XML by default since
hwloc does not know what it contains.
This behavior may be changed by specifying application-specific callbacks
with <tt>hwloc_topology_set_userdata_export_callback()</tt>
and <tt>hwloc_topology_set_userdata_import_callback()</tt>.

Each object may also contain some <em>info</em> attributes
(key name and value) that are setup by hwloc during discovery
and that may be extended by the user with
<tt>hwloc_obj_add_info()</tt> (see also \ref attributes).
Contrary to the <tt>userdata</tt> field which is unique, multiple info
attributes may exist for each object, even with the same name.
These attributes are always exported to XML.
However, only character strings may be used as key names and values.

It is also possible to insert Misc objects with a custom name
anywhere as a leaf of the topology (see \ref miscobjs).
And Misc objects may have their own userdata and info attributes
just like any other object.

The hwloc-annotate command-line tool may be used for adding
Misc objects and info attributes.

There is also a topology-specific userdata pointer that can be used
to recognize different topologies by storing a custom pointer.
It may be manipulated with <tt>hwloc_topology_set_userdata()</tt>
and <tt>hwloc_topology_get_userdata()</tt>.

\section faq3 Caveats



\subsection faq_slow_lstopo Why is hwloc slow?

Building a hwloc topology on a large machine may be slow because
the discovery of hundreds of hardware cores or threads takes time
(especially when reading thousands of sysfs files on Linux).
Ignoring some objects (for instance caches) that aren't useful
to the current application may improve this overhead (see \ref faq_why).
One should also consider using XML (see \ref faq_xml) to work
around such issues.

Additionally, lstopo enables most hwloc objects and discovery flags
by default so that the output topology is as precise as possible
(while hwloc disables many of them by default).
This includes I/O device discovery through PCI libraries as well as external
libraries such as NVML.
To speed up lstopo, you may disable such features with command-line
options such as <tt>\--no-io</tt>.

When NVIDIA GPU probing is enabled with CUDA or NVML, one should make sure that
the <em>Persistent</em> mode is enabled (with <tt>nvidia-smi -pm 1</tt>)
to avoid significant GPU initialization overhead.

When AMD GPU discovery is enabled with OpenCL and hwloc is used remotely
over ssh, some spurious round-trips on the network may significantly
increase the discovery time.
Forcing the <tt>DISPLAY</tt> environment variable to the remote X server
display (usually <tt>:0</tt>) instead of only setting the <tt>COMPUTE</tt>
variable may avoid this.

Also remember that these components may be disabled at build-time with
configure flags such as <tt>\--disable-opencl</tt>, <tt>\--disable-cuda</tt> or <tt>\--disable-nvml</tt>,
and at runtime with the environment variable
<tt>HWLOC_COMPONENTS=-opencl,cuda,nvml</tt>.


\subsection faq_privileged Does hwloc require privileged access?

hwloc discovers the topology by querying the operating system.
Some minor features may require privileged access to the operation
system.
For instance memory module and PCI link speed discovery on Linux
is reserved to root,
and the entire PCI discovery on Solaris and BSDs requires access to
some special files that are usually restricted to root
(/dev/pci* or /devices/pci*).

To workaround this limitation, it is recommended to export the
topology as a XML file generated by the administrator (with the
lstopo program) and make it available to all users
(see \ref xml).
It will offer all discovery information to any application without
requiring any privileged access anymore.
Only the necessary hardware characteristics will be exported, no
sensitive information will be disclosed through this XML export.

This XML-based model also has the advantage of speeding up the
discovery because reading a XML topology is usually much faster
than querying the operating system again.

The utility <tt>hwloc-dump-hwdata</tt> is also involved in gathering
privileged information at boot time and making it available to
non-privileged users (note that this may require a specific SELinux
MLS policy module). However, it only applies to Intel Knights Landing
Xeon Phi for now (see \ref faq_knl_dump).
See also <tt>HWLOC_DUMPED_HWDATA_DIR</tt> in \ref envvar for details
about the location of dumped files.


\subsection faq_os_error What should I do when hwloc reports "operating system" warnings?

When the operating system reports invalid locality information (because
of either software or hardware bugs), hwloc may fail to insert some objects
in the topology because they cannot fit in the already built tree of resources.
If so, hwloc will report a warning like the following.
The object causing this error is ignored, the discovery continues but the
resulting topology will miss some objects and may be asymmetric
(see also \ref faq_asymmetric).

\verbatim
****************************************************************************
* hwloc has encountered what looks like an error from the operating system.
*
* L3 (cpuset 0x000003f0) intersects with NUMANode (P#0 cpuset 0x0000003f) without inclusion!
* Error occurred in topology.c line 940
*
* Please report this error message to the hwloc user's mailing list,
* along with the files generated by the hwloc-gather-topology script.
****************************************************************************
\endverbatim

These errors are common on large AMD platforms because of BIOS and/or Linux
kernel bugs causing invalid L3 cache information.
In the above example, the hardware reports
a L3 cache that is shared by 2 cores in the first NUMA node and 4 cores
in the second NUMA node. That's wrong, it should actually be shared by all 6
cores in a single NUMA node.
The resulting topology will miss some L3 caches.

If your application does not care about cache sharing, or if you do not plan to
request cache-aware binding in your process launcher, you may likely ignore
this error (and hide it by setting HWLOC_HIDE_ERRORS=1 in your environment).

Some platforms report similar warnings about conflicting Packages and NUMANodes.

On x86 hosts, passing <tt>HWLOC_COMPONENTS=x86</tt> in the environment may
workaround some of these issues by switching to a different way to discover the topology.

Upgrading the BIOS and/or the operating system may help.
Otherwise, as explained in the message, reporting this issue to the hwloc developers
(by sending the tarball that is generated by the hwloc-gather-topology script
 on this platform) is a good way to make sure that this is a software
(operating system) or hardware bug (BIOS, etc).

See also \ref bugs. Opening an issue on GitHub automatically displays hints
on what information you should provide when reporting such bugs.


\subsection faq_valgrind Why does Valgrind complain about hwloc memory leaks?

If you are debugging your application with Valgrind, you want to
avoid memory leak reports that are caused by hwloc and not by your
program.

hwloc itself is often checked with Valgrind to make sure it does
not leak memory.
However, some global variables in hwloc dependencies are never freed.
For instance libz allocates its global state once at startup and
never frees it so that it may be reused later.
Some libxml2 global state is also never freed because hwloc does not
know whether it can safely ask libxml2 to free it (the application may
also be using libxml2 outside of hwloc).

These unfreed variables cause leak reports in Valgrind.
hwloc installs a Valgrind <em>suppressions</em> file to hide them.
You should pass the following command-line option to Valgrind to use it:
\verbatim
  --suppressions=/path/to/hwloc-valgrind.supp
\endverbatim


\subsection faq_upgrade How do I handle ABI breaks and API upgrades?

The hwloc interface is extended with every new major release.
Any application using the hwloc API should be prepared to check at
compile-time whether some features are available in the currently
installed hwloc distribution.

For instance, to check whether the hwloc version is at least 2.0, you should use:
\verbatim
#include <hwloc.h>
#if HWLOC_API_VERSION >= 0x00020000
...
#endif
\endverbatim

To check for the API of release X.Y.Z at build time,
you may compare ::HWLOC_API_VERSION with <tt>(X>>16)+(Y>>8)+Z</tt>.

For supporting older releases that do not have <tt>HWLOC_OBJ_NUMANODE</tt>
and <tt>HWLOC_OBJ_PACKAGE</tt> yet, you may use:

\verbatim
#include <hwloc.h>
#if HWLOC_API_VERSION < 0x00010b00
#define HWLOC_OBJ_NUMANODE HWLOC_OBJ_NODE
#define HWLOC_OBJ_PACKAGE HWLOC_OBJ_SOCKET
#endif
\endverbatim

The hwloc interface was deeply modified in release 2.0
to fix several issues of the 1.x interface
(see \ref upgrade_to_api_2x and the NEWS file in the source directory for details).
The ABI was broken, which means
<b>applications must be recompiled against the new 2.0 interface</b>.

To check that you are not mixing old/recent headers with a recent/old runtime library,
check the major revision number in the API version:
\verbatim
#include <hwloc.h>
  unsigned version = hwloc_get_api_version();
  if ((version >> 16) != (HWLOC_API_VERSION >> 16)) {
    fprintf(stderr,
           "%s compiled for hwloc API 0x%x but running on library API 0x%x.\n"
           "You may need to point LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the right hwloc library.\n"
           "Aborting since the new ABI is not backward compatible.\n",
           callname, HWLOC_API_VERSION, version);
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
  }
\endverbatim
To specifically detect v2.0 issues:
\verbatim
#include <hwloc.h>
#if HWLOC_API_VERSION >= 0x00020000
  /* headers are recent */
  if (hwloc_get_api_version() < 0x20000)
    ... error out, the hwloc runtime library is older than 2.0 ...
#else
  /* headers are pre-2.0 */
  if (hwloc_get_api_version() >= 0x20000)
    ... error out, the hwloc runtime library is more recent than 2.0 ...
#endif
\endverbatim

You should not try to remain compatible with very old releases such as
1.1.x or earlier because <tt>::HWLOC_API_VERSION</tt> was added in 1.0.0
and <tt>hwloc_get_api_version()</tt> came only in 1.1.1.
Also do not use the old cpuset API since it was deprecated and superseded
by the bitmap API in 1.1, and later removed in 1.5.

\section faq4 Platform-specific


\subsection faq_knl_numa How do I find the local MCDRAM NUMA node on Intel Knights Landing Xeon Phi?

Intel Knights Landing Xeon Phi processors introduce a new memory architecture by
possibly having two distinct local memories:
some normal memory (DDR) and some high-bandwidth on-package memory (MCDRAM).
Processors can be configured in various clustering modes to have up to 4 <em>Clusters</em>.
Moreover, each <em>Cluster</em> (quarter, half or whole processor) of the processor may have its own local
parts of the DDR and of the MCDRAM.
This memory and clustering configuration may be probed by looking at MemoryMode
and ClusterMode attributes, see \ref attributes_info and doc/examples/get-knl-modes.c
in the source directory.

Starting with version 2.0, hwloc properly exposes this memory
configuration.
DDR and MCDRAM are attached as two memory children of the same parent,
DDR first, and MCDRAM second if any.
Depending on the KNL configuration, that parent may be a Package,
a Cache, or a Group object of type <tt>Cluster</tt>.

Hence cores may have one or two local NUMA nodes, listed by the core nodeset.
An application may allocate local memory from a core by using that nodeset.
The operating system will actually allocate from the DDR when
possible, or fallback to the MCDRAM.

To allocate specifically on one of these memories,
one should walk up the parent pointers until finding an object with
some memory children.
Looking at these memory children will give the DDR first,
then the MCDRAM if any.
Their nodeset may then be used for allocating or binding memory buffers.

One may also traverse the list of NUMA nodes until finding some whose
cpuset matches the target core or PUs.
The MCDRAM NUMA nodes may be identified thanks to the <tt>subtype</tt> field
which is set to <tt>MCDRAM</tt>.

Command-line tools such as <tt>hwloc-bind</tt> may bind memory on the MCDRAM by
using the <i>hbm</i> keyword. For instance, to bind on the first MCDRAM NUMA node:

\verbatim
$ hwloc-bind --membind --hbm numa:0 -- myprogram
$ hwloc-bind --membind numa:0 -- myprogram
\endverbatim


\subsection faq_knl_dump Why do I need hwloc-dump-hwdata for memory on Intel Knights Landing Xeon Phi?

Intel Knights Landing Xeon Phi processors may use the on-package memory (MCDRAM)
as either memory or a memory-side cache (currently reported as a L3 cache by hwloc).
There are also several clustering modes that significantly affect the memory organization
(see \ref faq_knl_numa for more information about these modes).
Details about these are currently only available to privileged users.

The hwloc-dump-hwdata utility may be used to dump this privileged binary information
into human-readable and world-accessible files that the hwloc library will later load.
The utility should usually run as root once during boot, in order to update dumped
information (stored under /var/run/hwloc by default) in case the MCDRAM or clustering configuration
changed between reboots.

When SELinux MLS policy is enabled, a specific hwloc policy module may be required
so that all users get access to the dumped files (in /var/run/hwloc by default).
One may use hwloc policy files from the SELinux Reference Policy at
https://github.com/TresysTechnology/refpolicy-contrib
(see also the documentation at https://github.com/TresysTechnology/refpolicy/wiki/GettingStarted).

hwloc-dump-hwdata requires <tt>dmi-sysfs</tt> kernel module loaded.

The utility is currently unneeded on non-KNL platforms.

See <tt>HWLOC_DUMPED_HWDATA_DIR</tt> in \ref envvar for details
about the location of dumped files.


\subsection faq_phi How do I build for Intel Xeon Phi coprocessor?

\note This section does not apply to standalone Intel Knights Landing Xeon Phi.

Intel Knights Corner Xeon Phi coprocessors usually runs a Linux environment
but cross-compiling from the host is required.
hwloc uses standard autotools options for cross-compiling.
For instance, to build for a <em>Knights Corner (KNC)</em> coprocessor:

If building with <tt>icc</tt>:
\verbatim
./configure CC="icc -mmic" --host=x86_64-k1om-linux --build=x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
\endverbatim

If building with the Xeon Phi-specific GCC that comes with the MPSS environment,
for instance <tt>/usr/linux-k1om-4.7/bin/x86_64-k1om-linux-gcc</tt>:
\verbatim
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/linux-k1om-4.7/bin/
./configure --host=x86_64-k1om-linux --build=x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
\endverbatim


\subsection faq_bgq How do I build hwloc for BlueGene/Q?

IBM BlueGene/Q machines run a standard Linux on the login/frontend nodes
and a custom CNK (<em>Compute Node Kernel</em>) on the compute nodes.

To discover the topology of a login/frontend node, hwloc should be
configured as usual, without any BlueGene/Q-specific option.

However, one would likely rather discover the topology of the compute nodes
where parallel jobs are actually running.
If so, hwloc must be cross-compiled with the following configuration line:
\verbatim
./configure --host=powerpc64-bgq-linux --disable-shared --enable-static \
  CPPFLAGS='-I/bgsys/drivers/ppcfloor -I/bgsys/drivers/ppcfloor/spi/include/kernel/cnk/'
\endverbatim

CPPFLAGS may have to be updated if your platform headers are installed
in a different directory.


\subsection faq_windows How do I build hwloc for Windows?

hwloc releases are available as pre-built ZIPs for Windows on both 32bits and
64bits x86 platforms.
They are built using MSYS2 and MinGW on a Windows host.
Such an environment allows using the Unix-like <tt>configure</tt>, <tt>make</tt>
and <tt>make install</tt> steps without having to tweak too many variables or options.
One may look at <tt>contrib/ci.inria.fr/job-3-mingw.sh</tt> in the hwloc
repository for an example used for nightly testing.

hwloc releases also contain a basic Microsoft Visual Studio solution
under <tt>contrib/windows/</tt>.


\subsection faq_netbsd_bind How to get useful topology information on NetBSD?

The NetBSD (and FreeBSD) backend uses x86-specific topology discovery
(through the x86 component).
This implementation requires CPU binding so as to query topology
information from each individual logical processor.
This means that hwloc cannot find any useful topology information
unless user-level process binding is allowed by the NetBSD kernel.
The <tt>security.models.extensions.user_set_cpu_affinity</tt>
sysctl variable must be set to 1 to do so.
Otherwise, only the number of logical processors will be detected.

\section upgrade_to_api_2x_memory New Organization of NUMA nodes and Memory

\subsection upgrade_to_api_2x_memory_children Memory children

In hwloc v1.x, NUMA nodes were inside the tree, for instance Packages
contained 2 NUMA nodes which contained a L3 and several cache.

Starting with hwloc v2.0, NUMA nodes are not in the main tree anymore.
They are attached under objects as <i>Memory Children</i> on the side
of normal children.
This memory children list starts at <code>obj->memory_first_child</code>
and its size is <code>obj->memory_arity</code>.
Hence there can now exist two local NUMA nodes, for instance on KNL.

The normal list of children (starting at <code>obj->first_child</code>,
ending at <code>obj->last_child</code>, of size <code>obj->arity</code>,
and available as the array <code>obj->children</code>)
now only contains CPU-side objects:
PUs, Cores, Packages, Caches, Groups, Machine and System.
hwloc_get_next_child() may still be used to iterate over all children of all lists.

Hence the CPU-side hierarchy is built using normal children,
while memory is attached to that hierarchy depending on its affinity.

\subsection upgrade_to_api_2x_memory_examples Examples

<ul>
<li>a UMA machine with 2 packages and a single NUMA node is now modeled
 as a "Machine" object with two "Package" children
 and one "NUMANode" memory children (displayed first in lstopo below):
\verbatim
Machine (1024MB total)
  NUMANode L#0 (P#0 1024MB)
  Package L#0
    Core L#0 + PU L#0 (P#0)
    Core L#1 + PU L#1 (P#1)
  Package L#1
    Core L#2 + PU L#2 (P#2)
    Core L#3 + PU L#3 (P#3)
\endverbatim
</li>

<li>a machine with 2 packages with one NUMA node and 2 cores in each is now:
\verbatim
Machine (2048MB total)
  Package L#0
    NUMANode L#0 (P#0 1024MB)
    Core L#0 + PU L#0 (P#0)
    Core L#1 + PU L#1 (P#1)
  Package L#1
    NUMANode L#1 (P#1 1024MB)
    Core L#2 + PU L#2 (P#2)
    Core L#3 + PU L#3 (P#3)
\endverbatim
</li>

<li>if there are two NUMA nodes per package, a Group object may be added to keep
cores together with their local NUMA node:
\verbatim
Machine (4096MB total)
  Package L#0
    Group0 L#0
      NUMANode L#0 (P#0 1024MB)
      Core L#0 + PU L#0 (P#0)
      Core L#1 + PU L#1 (P#1)
    Group0 L#1
      NUMANode L#1 (P#1 1024MB)
      Core L#2 + PU L#2 (P#2)
      Core L#3 + PU L#3 (P#3)
  Package L#1
    [...]
\endverbatim
</li>

<li>if the platform has L3 caches whose localities are identical to NUMA nodes, Groups aren't needed:
\verbatim
Machine (4096MB total)
  Package L#0
    L3 L#0 (16MB)
      NUMANode L#0 (P#0 1024MB)
      Core L#0 + PU L#0 (P#0)
      Core L#1 + PU L#1 (P#1)
    L3 L#1 (16MB)
      NUMANode L#1 (P#1 1024MB)
      Core L#2 + PU L#2 (P#2)
      Core L#3 + PU L#3 (P#3)
  Package L#1
    [...]
\endverbatim
</li>
</ul>


\subsection upgrade_to_api_2x_numa_level NUMA level and depth

NUMA nodes are not in "main" tree of normal objects anymore.
Hence, they don't have a meaningful depth anymore (like I/O and Misc objects).
They have a virtual (negative) depth (::HWLOC_TYPE_DEPTH_NUMANODE)
so that functions manipulating depths and level still work,
and so that we can still iterate over the level of NUMA nodes just like for any other level.

For instance we can still use lines such as
\verbatim
int depth = hwloc_get_type_depth(topology, HWLOC_OBJ_NUMANODE);
hwloc_obj_t obj = hwloc_get_obj_by_type(topology, HWLOC_OBJ_NUMANODE, 4);
hwloc_obj_t node = hwloc_get_next_obj_by_depth(topology, HWLOC_TYPE_DEPTH_NUMANODE, prev);
\endverbatim

The NUMA depth should not be compared with others.
An unmodified code that still compares NUMA and Package depths
(to find out whether Packages contain NUMA or the contrary)
would now always assume Packages contain NUMA (because the NUMA depth is negative).

However, the depth of the Normal parents of NUMA nodes may be used instead.
In the last example above, NUMA nodes are attached to L3 caches,
hence one may compare the depth of Packages and L3 to find out
that NUMA nodes are contained in Packages.
This depth of parents may be retrieved with hwloc_get_memory_parents_depth().
However, this function may return ::HWLOC_TYPE_DEPTH_MULTIPLE
on future platforms if NUMA nodes are attached to different levels.


\subsection upgrade_to_api_2x_memory_find Finding Local NUMA nodes and looking at Children and Parents

Applications that walked up/down to find NUMANode parent/children must
now be updated.
Instead of looking directly for a NUMA node, one should now look for
an object that has some memory children.
NUMA node(s) will be be attached there.
For instance, when looking for a NUMA node above a given core <tt>core</tt>:
\verbatim
hwloc_obj_t parent = core->parent;
while (parent && !parent->memory_arity)
  parent = parent->parent; /* no memory child, walk up */
if (parent)
  /* use parent->memory_first_child (and its siblings if there are multiple local NUMA nodes) */
\endverbatim

The list of local NUMA nodes (usually a single one) is also described
by the <tt>nodeset</tt> attribute of each object (which contains the
physical indexes of these nodes).
Iterating over the NUMA level is also an easy way to find local NUMA nodes:
\verbatim
hwloc_obj_t tmp = NULL;
while ((tmp = hwloc_get_next_obj_by_type(topology, HWLOC_OBJ_NUMANODE, tmp)) != NULL) {
  if (hwloc_bitmap_isset(obj->nodeset, tmp->os_index))
    /* tmp is a NUMA node local to obj, use it */
}
\endverbatim

Similarly finding objects that are close to a given NUMA nodes
should be updated too.
Instead of looking at the NUMA node parents/children, one should
now find a Normal parent above that NUMA node, and then look
at its parents/children as usual:
\verbatim
hwloc_obj_t tmp = obj->parent;
while (hwloc_obj_type_is_memory(tmp))
  tmp = tmp->parent;
/* now use tmp instead of obj */
\endverbatim

To avoid such hwloc v2.x-specific and NUMA-specific cases in the code,
a <b>generic lookup for any kind of object, including NUMA nodes</b>,
might also be implemented by iterating over a level.
For instance finding an object of type <tt>type</tt> which either
contains or is included in object <tt>obj</tt> can be
performed by traversing the level of that type and comparing CPU sets:
\verbatim
hwloc_obj_t tmp = NULL;
while ((tmp = hwloc_get_next_obj_by_type(topology, type, tmp)) != NULL) {
  if (hwloc_bitmap_intersects(tmp->cpuset, obj->cpuset))
    /* tmp matches, use it */
}
\endverbatim
<b>
This generic lookup works whenever <tt>type</tt> or <tt>obj</tt>
are Normal or Memory objects since both have CPU sets.
Moreover, it is compatible with the hwloc v1.x API.
</b>

\section upgrade_to_api_2x_children 4 Kinds of Objects and Children

\subsection upgrade_to_api_2x_io_misc_children I/O and Misc children

I/O children are not in the main object children list anymore either.
They are in the list starting at <code>obj->io_first_child</code>
and whose size if <code>obj->io_arity</code>.

Misc children are not in the main object children list anymore.
They are in the list starting at <code>obj->misc_first_child</code>
nd whose size if <code>obj->misc_arity</code>.

See hwloc_obj for details about children lists.

hwloc_get_next_child() may still be used to iterate over all children of all lists.


\subsection upgrade_to_api_2x_kinds_subsec Kinds of objects

Given the above, objects may now be of 4 kinds:
<ul>
<li>Normal (everything not listed below, including Machine, Package, Core, PU, CPU Caches, etc);</li>
<li>Memory (currently only NUMA nodes), attached to parents as Memory children;</li>
<li>I/O (Bridges, PCI and OS devices), attached to parents as I/O children;</li>
<li>Misc objects, attached to parents as Misc children.</li>
</ul>
See hwloc_obj for details about children lists.

For a given object type, the kind may be found with hwloc_obj_type_is_normal(),
hwloc_obj_type_is_memory(), hwloc_obj_type_is_normal(),
or comparing with ::HWLOC_OBJ_MISC.

Normal and Memory objects have (non-NULL) CPU sets and nodesets,
while I/O and Misc objects don't have any sets (they are NULL).

\section upgrade_to_api_2x_cache HWLOC_OBJ_CACHE replaced

Instead of a single HWLOC_OBJ_CACHE, there are now 8 types
::HWLOC_OBJ_L1CACHE, ..., ::HWLOC_OBJ_L5CACHE,
::HWLOC_OBJ_L1ICACHE, ..., ::HWLOC_OBJ_L3ICACHE.

Cache object attributes are unchanged.

hwloc_get_cache_type_depth() is not needed to disambiguate cache types anymore
since new types can be passed to hwloc_get_type_depth()
without ever getting ::HWLOC_TYPE_DEPTH_MULTIPLE anymore.

hwloc_obj_type_is_cache(), hwloc_obj_type_is_dcache() and hwloc_obj_type_is_icache()
may be used to check whether a given type is a cache, data/unified cache or instruction cache.

\section upgrade_to_api_2x_allowed allowed_cpuset and allowed_nodeset only in the main topology

Objects do not have <code>allowed_cpuset</code> and <code>allowed_nodeset</code> anymore.
They are only available for the entire topology using
hwloc_topology_get_allowed_cpuset() and hwloc_topology_get_allowed_nodeset().

As usual, those are only needed when the WHOLE_SYSTEM topology flag is given,
which means disallowed objects are kept in the topology.
If so, one may find out whether some PUs inside an object is allowed by checking
\verbatim
hwloc_bitmap_intersects(obj->cpuset, hwloc_topology_get_allowed_cpuset(topology))
\endverbatim
Replace cpusets with nodesets for NUMA nodes.

hwloc_topology_set_type_filter(topology, type, HWLOC_TYPE_FILTER_KEEP_STRUCTURE);
hwloc_topology_set_all_types_filter(topology, HWLOC_TYPE_FILTER_KEEP_STRUCTURE);

Also, the meaning of KEEP_STRUCTURE has changed (only entire levels may be ignored, instead of single objects), the old behavior is not available anymore.
</li>

<li>
HWLOC_TOPOLOGY_FLAG_ICACHES is superseded by
\verbatim
hwloc_topology_set_icache_types_filter(topology, HWLOC_TYPE_FILTER_KEEP_ALL);

\section upgrade_to_api_2x_xml XML changes

2.0 XML files are not compatible with 1.x

2.0 can load 1.x files, but only NUMA distances are imported. Other distance matrices are ignored
 (they were never used by default anyway).

2.0 can export 1.x-compatible files, but only distances attached to the root object are exported
(i.e. distances that cover the entire machine).
Other distance matrices are dropped (they were never used by default anyway).

<b>Users are advised to negociate hwloc versions between exporter and importer:</b>
If the importer isn't 2.x, the exporter should export to 1.x.
Otherwise, things should work by default.

Hence hwloc_topology_export_xml() and hwloc_topology_export_xmlbuffer() have a new flags argument.
to force a hwloc-1.x-compatible XML export.
<ul>
<li>
 If both always support 2.0, don't pass any flag.
</li>
<li>
 When the importer uses hwloc 1.x, export with ::HWLOC_TOPOLOGY_EXPORT_XML_FLAG_V1.
 Otherwise the importer will fail to import.
</li>
<li>
 When the exporter uses hwloc 1.x, it cannot pass any flag,

\section upgrade_to_api_2x_distances Distances API totally rewritten

The new distances API is in hwloc/distances.h.

Distances are not accessible directly from objects anymore.
One should first call hwloc_distances_get() (or a variant)
to retrieve distances (possibly with one call to get the
number of available distances structures, and another call
to actually get them).
Then it may consult these structures, and finally release them.

The set of object involved in a distances structure is specified

\section upgrade_to_api_2x_return Return values of functions

Bitmap functions (and a couple other functions) can return errors (in theory).

Most bitmap functions may have to reallocate the internal bitmap storage.
In v1.x, they would silently crash if realloc failed.
In v2.0, they now return an int that can be negative on error.
However, the preallocated storage is 512 bits,
hence realloc will not even be used unless you run
hwloc on machines with larger PU or NUMAnode indexes.

hwloc_obj_add_info(), hwloc_cpuset_from_nodeset() and hwloc_cpuset_from_nodeset()
