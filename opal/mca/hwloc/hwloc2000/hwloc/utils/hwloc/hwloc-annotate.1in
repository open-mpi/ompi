.SH OPTIONS
.
.TP 10
\fB\-\-ri\fR
Remove all info attributes that exist with the same name before adding the new one.
This option is only accepted in "info" mode.
If the info value is omitted, existing infos are replaced with nothing.
.TP
\fB\-\-ci\fR
Clear the existing info attributes in the target objects before annotating.
If no new annotation has to be added after clearing, \fImode\fR should be
set to \fInone\fR.
.TP
\fB\-\-cu\fR
Clear the existing userdata from the target objects.
If nothing else has to be performed after clearing, \fImode\fR should be
set to \fInone\fR.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-cd\fR
Clear the existing distances from the topology.
If nothing else has to be performed after clearing, \fImode\fR should be
set to \fInone\fR.

.\"    Description Section
.\" **************************
.SH DESCRIPTION
.
hwloc-annotate loads a topology from a XML file, adds some annotations,
and export the resulting topology to another XML file.
The input and output files may be the same.
.
.PP
The annotation may be string info attributes.
This is specified by the \fImode\fR:
.
.TP
.B info <name> <value>
Specifies a new string info attribute whose name is \fIname\fR and
value is \fIvalue\fR.
.TP
.B misc <name>
Specifies a new Misc object name.
.TP
.B distances <filename> [<flags>]
Specifies new distances to be added to the topology using specifications in \fI<filename>\fR.
The optional \fIflags\fR (0 unless specified) corresponds to the flags
given to the function \fBhwloc_distances_set()\fR.
\fIlocation\fR is ignored in this mode.

The first line of the pointed file must be a integer representing
a distances \fBkind\fR as defined in \fBhwloc/distances.h\fR.
The second line is the number of objects involved in the distances.
The next lines contain one object each.
The next lines contain one distance value each,
or a single line may be given with a integer combination of format \fBx*y\fR or \fBx*y*z\fR.
.TP
.B none
No new annotation is added. This is useful when clearing existing attributes.
.
.PP
Annotations may be added to one specific object in the topology,
all of them, or all of a given type.
This is specified by the \fIlocation\fR (see also EXAMPLES below).
Objects may be specified as location tuples, as explained in hwloc(7).
However hexadecimal bitmasks are not accepted since they may correspond to multiple objects.
.
.PP
.B NOTE:
The existing annotations may be listed with hwloc-info.
.PP
.B NOTE:
It is highly recommended that you read the hwloc(7) overview page
before reading this man page.  Most of the concepts described in
hwloc(7) directly apply to the hwloc-annotate utility.

.\"    Examples Section
.\" **************************
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
hwloc-annotate's operation is best described through several examples.
.
.PP
Add an info attribute to all Core objects:

    $ hwloc-annotate input.xml output.xml Core:all info infoname infovalue

Add a Misc object named "foobar" under the root object of the topology
and modify the input XML directly:

    $ hwloc-annotate file.xml file.xml root misc foobar

Add an info attribute to OS device #2 and #3:

    $ hwloc-annotate input.xml output.xml os:2-3 info infoname infovalue

Change package objects to green with red text in the lstopo graphical output:

    $ hwloc-annotate topo.xml topo.xml package:all info lstopoStyle "Background=#00ff00;Text=#ff0000"
    $ lstopo -i topo.xml
.
.\" **************************
.\" Return value section
.\" **************************
.SH RETURN VALUE
Upon successful execution, hwloc-annotate generates the output topology.
The return value is 0.
.
.PP
hwloc-annotate will return nonzero if any kind of error occurs, such as
(but not limited to) failure to parse the command line.
