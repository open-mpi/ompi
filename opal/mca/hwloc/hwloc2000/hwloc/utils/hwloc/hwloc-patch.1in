.SH DESCRIPTION
.
hwloc-patch loads the difference between two topologies from a XML file
(or from the standard input) and applies it to an
existing topology, generating a new, modified one.
.
.PP
The XML difference may have been computed earlier with hwloc-diff
or hwloc-compress-dir.
.
.PP
If <output.xml> is given, the new, modified topology is stored in that
new file. Otherwise, <topology.xml> is modified in place.
.
.PP
If \fBrefname\fR is given instead of <topology.xml>, the input topology filename
is automatically guessed by reading the refname field of the XML diff file.
By default hwloc-diff generates XML diffs with the right reference topology
filename (without any path prefix).
.
.PP
If \fB-\fR is given instead of <diff.xml>, the topology difference is read from
the standard input.
.
.PP
.B NOTE:
If some application-specific userdata were been exported to the input XMLs,
they will be ignored and discarded from the output because hwloc has no way
to understand and patch them.
.
.PP
.B NOTE:
It is highly recommended that you read the hwloc(7) overview page
before reading this man page.  Most of the concepts described in
hwloc(7) directly apply to the hwloc-patch utility.

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
hwloc-patch's operation is best described through several examples.
.
.PP
Apply a XML topology difference file to an existing topology:

    $ hwloc-patch fourmi023.xml diff.xml fourmi023-new.xml

Apply a XML topology difference file whole refname field contains the right input topology:

    $ hwloc-patch refname diff.xml fourmi023-new.xml

Apply a XML topology from the standard intput:

    $ cat diff.xml | hwloc-patch fourmi023.xml - fourmi023-new.xml

Directly compute the difference between two topologies and apply it
to another one, in place:

    $ hwloc-diff fourmi023.xml fourmi024.xml | hwloc-patch fourmi025.xml -

.

.\" Return value section
.\" **************************
.SH RETURN VALUE
Upon successful execution, hwloc-patch outputs the modified topology.
The return value is 0.
.
.PP
hwloc-patch also returns nonzero if any kind of error occurs, such as
(but not limited to) failure to parse the command line.
