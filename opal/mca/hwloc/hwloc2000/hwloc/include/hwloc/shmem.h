/** \defgroup hwlocality_shmem Sharing topologies between processes
 *
 * These functions are used to share a topology between processes by
 * duplicating it into a file-backed shared-memory buffer.
 *
 * The master process must first get the required shared-memory size
 * for storing this topology with hwloc_shmem_topology_get_length().
 *
 * Then it must find a virtual memory area of that size that is available
 * in all processes (identical virtual addresses in all processes).
 * On Linux, this can be done by comparing holes found in /proc/\<pid\>/maps
 * for each process.
 *
 * Once found, it must open a destination file for storing the buffer,
 * and pass it to hwloc_shmem_topology_write() together with
 * virtual memory address and length obtained above.
 *
 * Other processes may then adopt this shared topology by opening the
 * same file and passing it to hwloc_shmem_topology_adopt() with the
 * exact same virtual memory address and length.

 * The returned adopted topology in \p topologyp can be used just like any

 * For instance, it cannot be modified with hwloc_topology_restrict()
 * and object userdata pointers cannot be changed.

 * the requested mapping virtual address \p mmap_address and the length \p length
 * must be identical to what was given to hwloc_shmem_topology_write() earlier.
 *
 * \note Flags \p flags are currently unused, must be 0.
 *
 * \note The object userdata pointer should not be used unless the process
 * that created the shared topology also placed userdata-pointed buffers
 * in shared memory.

 * is different between the writer process and the adopter process.
