This directory contains tarballs of Linux sysfs hierarchies collected on
various systems.  Each tarball `xyz.tar.bz2' comes with the corresponding
`xyz.output', which gives the expected output of "lstopo -v -" for that
system.

Together with the `HWLOC_FSROOT' environment variable, these are
used by `test-topology.sh' to check for any regression introduced in
hwloc detection logic.

A new topology may be added by:
* running "hwloc-gather-topology" on the target system and saving the
  tarball and output files here.
* if lstopo is not available on the target system, running "lstopo -v -"
  on the extracted tarball to generate the corresponding `output' file
  locally.
* adding the tarball and output files to Makefile.am so that they are
  properly handled in "make check" and "make dist".

When adding a XML-based output, make sure that the filename of the
tarball ends with .xml.tar.bz2 (so that test-topology may skip it
if XML support is disabled).

If a `xyz.options' file is found, it will override the `lstopo' options
(`-v -' by default) for generating the output `xyz.output'.

If the output and tarball names do not match, it is possible to specify
the actual tarball name in a `xyz.source' file.
If some files should be excluded when extracting the tarball, they may
be listed in a `xyz.exclude' file. For instance, to exclude `/sys/*/foo'
from the saved topology, you should add `*/sys/foo' to `xyz.exclude'.
These features are especially useful when the same tarball should be
used for different tests with different configurations and thus different
expected outputs, without having to save multiple copies of the tarball.
