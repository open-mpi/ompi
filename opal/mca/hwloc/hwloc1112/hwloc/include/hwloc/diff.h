/** \defgroup hwlocality_diff Topology differences
 *
 * Applications that manipulate many similar topologies, for instance
 * one for each node of a homogeneous cluster, may want to compress
 * topologies to reduce the memory footprint.
 *
 * This file offers a way to manipulate the difference between topologies
 * and export/import it to/from XML.
 * Compression may therefore be achieved by storing one topology
 * entirely while the others are only described by their differences
 * with the former.
 * The actual topology can be reconstructed when actually needed by
 * applying the precomputed difference to the reference topology.
 *
 * This interface targets very similar nodes.
 * Only very simple differences between topologies are actually
 * supported, for instance a change in the memory size, the name
 * of the object, or some info attribute.
 * More complex differences such as adding or removing objects cannot
 * be represented in the difference structures and therefore return
 * errors.
 *
 * It means that there is no need to apply the difference when
 * looking at the tree organization (how many levels, how many
 * objects per level, what kind of objects, CPU and node sets, etc)
 * and when binding to objects.
 * However the difference must be applied when looking at object
 * attributes such as the name, the memory size or info attributes.

 * simultaneously.
 *
 * If the difference between 2 objects is too complex to be represented
 * (for instance if some objects have different types, or different numbers
 * of children), a special diff entry of type ::HWLOC_TOPOLOGY_DIFF_TOO_COMPLEX
 * is queued.
 * The computation of the diff does not continue below these objects.
 * So each such diff entry means that the difference between two subtrees
 * could not be computed.
 *
 * \return 0 if the difference can be represented properly.
 *
 * \return 0 with \p diff pointing to NULL if there is no difference
 * between the topologies.
 *
 * \return 1 if the difference is too complex (see above). Some entries in
 * the list will be of type ::HWLOC_TOPOLOGY_DIFF_TOO_COMPLEX.
 *
 * \return -1 on any other error.
 *
 * \note \p flags is currently not used. It should be 0.
 *
 * \note The output diff has to be freed with hwloc_topology_diff_destroy().
 *
 * \note The output diff can only be exported to XML or passed to
 * hwloc_topology_diff_apply() if 0 was returned, i.e. if no entry of type
 * ::HWLOC_TOPOLOGY_DIFF_TOO_COMPLEX is listed.
 *
 * \note The output diff may be modified by removing some entries from
 * the list. The removed entries should be freed by passing them to
 * to hwloc_topology_diff_destroy() (possible as another list).
