===========================================================================

This is the Portable Linux Processor Affinity (PLPA) package
(pronounced "pli-pa").  It is intended for developers who wish to use
Linux processor affinity via the sched_setaffinity() and
sched_getaffinity() library calls, but don't want to wade through the
morass of 3 different APIs that have been offered through the life of
these calls in various Linux distributions and glibc versions.

Specifically, to compile for any given Linux system, you need some
complex compile-time tests to figure out which of the 3 APIs to use.
And if you want your application to be binary portable across
different Linux distributions, more complex run-time tests (and horrid
compile-time trickery) are required to figure out which API the system
you are running on uses.  

These problems all stem from the fact that the same 2 symbols have had
three different APIs (with different numbers and types of
parameters) throughout their life in Linux.  Ick.

The PLPA is an attempt to solve this problem by providing a single API
that developers can write to.  It provides three things:

1. A single API that developers can write to, regardless of what
   back-end API the system you are compiling on has.
2. A run-time test and dispatch that will invoke the Right back-end
   API depending on what back-end API the system you are running on
   has.
3. Mapping information between (socket, core) tuples and Linux virtual
   processor IDs.

This package is actually pretty small.  It does not attempt to have
many extra bells and whistles.  Anyone could write it and package it.
We did it simply because it appears that no one else has yet done
this.  In a world where larger scale SMPs are [again] becoming more
common, particularly where at least some of them are NUMA-based
architectures, processor affinity is going to become more and more
important.  Just because developers have not yet realized that they
have this problem does not mean that they won't evenutally figure it
out.  :-)

Note that if you're looking into processor affinity, if you're on a
NUMA machine, you probably also want to look into libnuma:

    ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/people/ak/numa/

We hope that PLPA helps you.

===========================================================================

What, exactly, is the problem?
------------------------------

There are at least 3 different ways that sched_setaffinity is
implemented in glibc (only one of which is documented in the
sched_setaffinity(2) man page), and some corresponding changes
to what the kernel considers to be valid arguments:

1. int sched_setaffinity(pid_t pid, unsigned int len, unsigned
                         long *mask);

This originated in the time period of 2.5 kernels and some distros
back-ported it to their 2.4 kernels and libraries.  It's unknown if
this version was ever packaged with any 2.6 kernels.

2. int sched_setaffinity (pid_t __pid, size_t __cpusetsize,
                          const cpu_set_t *__cpuset);

This appears to be in recent distros using 2.6 kernels.  We don't
know exactly when #1 changed into #2.  However, this prototype is nice
because the cpu_set_t type is accompanied by fdset-like CPU_ZERO(),
CPU_SET(), CPU_ISSET(), etc. macros.

3. int sched_setaffinity (pid_t __pid, const cpu_set_t *__mask);

(note the missing len parameter) This is in at least some Linux
distros (e.g., MDK 10.0 with a 2.6.3 kernel, and SGI Altix, even
though the Altix uses a 2.4-based kernel and therefore likely
back-ported the 2.5 work or originated it in the first place).
Similar to #2, the cpu_set_t type is accompanied by fdset-like
CPU_ZERO(), CPU_SET(), CPU_ISSET(), etc. macros.

But wait, it gets worse.

Remember that getting/setting processor affinity has to involve the
kernel.  The sched_[sg]etaffinity() glibc functions typically do a
little error checking and then make a syscall down into the kernel to
actually do the work.  There are multiple possibilities for problems
here as the amount of checking has changed:

1. The glibc may support the affinity functions, but the kernel may
   not (and vice versa).

   This is typically only an issue with slightly older Linux distributions.
   Mandrake 9.2 is an example of this.  PLPA can detect this at run-time
   and turn its internal functions into no-ops and return appropriate error
   codes (ENOSYS).

2. The glibc affinity functions may be buggy (i.e., they pass bad data
   down to the syscall).

   This is fortunately restricted to some older versions of glibc, and
   is relatively easy to check for at run-time.  PLPA reliably detects
   this situation at run-time and returns appropriate error codes
   (ENOSYS).

   The original SuSE 9.1 version seems to have this problem, but it was
   fixed it somewhere in the SuSE patching history (it is unknown exactly
   when).  Specifically, updating to the latest SuSE 9.1 patch level
   (as of Dec 2005) seems to fix the problem.

3. The CPU_* macros for manipulating cpu_set_t bitmasks may not
   compile because of typo bugs in system header files.

   PLPA avoids this problem by providing its own PLPA_CPU_* macros for
   manipulating CPU bitmasks.  See "How do I use PLPA?", below, for
   more details.

The PLPA avoids all the glibc issues by using syscall() to directly
access the kernel set and get affinity functions.  This is described
below.

===========================================================================

How does PLPA work?
-------------------

Jeff Squyres initially sent a mail to the Open MPI developer's mailing
list explaining the Linux processor affinity problems and asking for
help coming up with a solution (particularly for binary
compatibility):

    http://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/devel/2005/11/0558.php

Discussion on that thread and others eventually resulted in the
run-time tests that form the heart of the PLPA.  Many thanks to Paul
Hargrove and Bogdan Costescu for their time and effort to get these
tests right.

PLPA was written so that other developers who want to use processor
affinity in Linux don't have to go through this mess.  The PLPA
provides a single interface that can be used on any platform,
regardless of which back-end API variant it has.  This includes both
the sched_setaffinity() and sched_getaffinity() calls as well as the
CPU_*() macros.

The PLPA avoids glibc altogether -- although tests were developed that
could *usually* figure out which glibc variant to use at run time,
there were still some cases where it was either impossible to
determine or the glibc interface itself was buggy.  Hence, it was
decided that a simpler approach was simply to use syscall() to invoke
the back-end kernel functions directly.

The kernel functions have gone through a few changes as well, so the
PLPA does a few run-time tests to determine which variant to use
before actually invoking the back-end functions with the
user-specified arguments.

NOTE: The run-time tests that the PLPA performs involve getting the
current affinity for the process in question and then attempting to
set them back to the same value.  By definition, this introduces a
race condition (there is no atomic get-and-set functionality for
processor affinity).  The PLPA cannot guarantee consistent results if
multiple entities (such as multiple threads or multiple processes) are
setting the affinity for a process at the same time.  In a worst case
scenario, the PLPA may actually determine that it cannot determine the
kernel variant at run time if another entity modifies a process'
affinity while PLPA is executing its run-time tests.

===========================================================================

Does PLPA make truly portable binaries?
---------------------------------------

As much as Linux binaries are portable, yes.  That is, if you have
within your power to make a binary that is runnable on several
different Linux distributions/versions/etc., then you may run into
problems with the Linux processor affinity functions.  PLPA attempts
to solve this problem for you by *also* making the Linux processor
affinity calls be binary portable.

Hence, you need to start with something that is already binary
portable (perhaps linking everything statically) -- then PLPA will be
of help to you.  Do not fall into the misconception that PLPA will
magically make your executable be binary portable between different
Linux variants.

===========================================================================

How do I use PLPA?
------------------

There are three main uses of the PLPA:

1. Using the plpa-info executable to check if your system supports
   processor affinity and the PLPA can determine which to use at run-time.
2. Developers using the PLPA library to enable source and binary Linux
   processor affinity portability.
3. Using the plpa-taskset executable to bind arbitrary executables to
   Linux virtual procesor IDs and/or specific sockets/core.

In more detail:

1. The plpa-info executable is a simple call into the PLPA library
   that checks which API variant the system it is running on has.  If
   the kernel supports processor affinity and the PLPA is able to
   figure out which API variant to use, it prints "Kernel affinity
   support: no".  Other responses indicate an error.

   Since the PLPA library abstracts this kind of problem away, this is
   more a diagnostic tool than anything else.  Note that plpa-info is
   *only* compiled and installed if PLPA is installed as a standalone
   package (see below).

   See "plpa-info --help" for more information.  A man page does not
   yet exist, unfortunately.

2. Developers can use this package by including the <plpa.h> header
   file and using the following prototypes:

   int plpa_sched_setaffinity(pid_t pid, size_t cpusetsize,
                              const plpa_cpu_set_t *cpuset);

   int plpa_sched_getaffinity(pid_t pid, size_t cpusetsize,
                              const plpa_cpu_set_t *cpuset)

   These functions perform run-time tests to determine which back-end
   API variant exists on the system and then dispatch to it correctly.
   The units of cpusetsize is number of bytes.  This should normally
   just be sizeof(*cpuset), but is made available as a parameter to
   allow for future expansion of the PLPA (stay tuned).

   The observant reader will notice that this is remarkably similar to
   the one of the Linux API's (the function names are different and
   the CPU set type is different).  PLPA also provides several macros
   for manipulating the plpa_cpu_set_t bitmask, quite similar to FDSET
   macros (see "What, Exactly, Is the Problem?" above for a
   description of problems with the native CPU_* macros):

   - PLPA_CPU_ZERO(&cpuset): Sets all bits in a plpa_cpu_set_t to
     zero.
   - PLPA_CPU_SET(num, &cpuset): Sets bit <num> of <cpuset> to one.
   - PLPA_CPU_CLR(num, &cpuset): Sets bit <num> of <cpuset> to zero.
   - PLPA_CPU_ISSET(num, &cpuset): Returns one if bit <num> of
     <cpuset> is one; returns zero otherwise.

   Note that all four macros take a *pointer* to a plpa_cpu_set_t, as
   denoted by "&cpuset" in the descriptions above.

   The following API functions are also available on kernels that
   support topology information (e.g., 2.6.16 or later):

   - plpa_map_to_processor_id()
   - plpa_map_to_socket_core()
   - plpa_max_processor_id()
   - plpa_max_socket()
   - plpa_max_core()

   On unsupported kernels, a negative value is returned to indicate
   graceful failure.  Additionally, the function
   plpa_have_topology_information() can be called to determine whether
   a kernel supports the topology information or not.  It returns 1 if
   the information is available (and therefore the above plpa_*()
   functions return meaningful values) or 0 if the information is
   unavailable (and therefore the above plpa_*() functions return a
   negative value indicating failure).

   Note that invoking any of the topology functions (including
   plpa_have_topology_information()) will allocate memory from the
   heap.  To release this memory, call plpa_finalize().

   Note that the special case of invoking any of the topology
   functions on an unsupported kernel will not allocate any memory;
   invoking plpa_finalize() is therefore unnecessary, but harmless.

   See plpa.h for a bit more information on these functions.  Detailed
   documentation such as man pages is still lacking, unfortunately.

3. The plpa-taskset executable represents an evolution of the
   venerable "taskset(1)" command.  It allows binding of arbitrary
   processes to specific Linux virtual processors and/or specific
   sockets/cores.  It supports all the same command line syntax of the
   taskset command, but also supports additional syntax for specifying
   sockets/cores (plpa-taskset will figure out the mapping from the
   socket/core specification to the appropriate Linux virtual
   processor IDs).

   Hence, you can launch processor-bound jobs without needing to
   modify their source code to call the PLPA library.

   See "plpa-taskset --help" for more information on the command line
   options available, and brief examples of usage.  A man page does
   not yet exist, unfortunately.

===========================================================================

How do I compile / install the PLPA as a standalone package?
------------------------------------------------------------

The PLPA uses the standard GNU Autoconf/Automake/Libtool toolset to
build and install itself.  This means that generally, the following
works:

shell$ ./configure --prefix=/where/you/want/to/install
[...lots of output...]
shell$ make all
[...lots of output...]
shell$ make install

Depending on your --prefix, you may need to run the "make install"
step as root or some other privileged user.

"make install" will install the following:

- <plpa.h> in $includedir (typically $prefix/include)
- libplpa.la and libplpa.a and/or libplpa.so in $libdir (typically
  $prefix/lib)
- plpa-info executable in $bindir (typically $prefix/bin)

Note that since PLPA builds itself with GNU Libtool, it can be built
as a static or shared library (or both).  The default is to build a
shared library.  You can enable building a static library by supplying
the "--enable-static" argument to configure; you can disable building
the shared library by supplying the "--disable-shared" argument to
configure.  "make install" will install whichever library was built
(or both).

"make uninstall" will fully uninstall PLPA from the prefix directory
(again, depending in filesystem permissions, you may need to run this
as root or some privileged user).

===========================================================================

How do I include PLPA in my software package?
---------------------------------------------

It can be desirable to include PLPA in a larger software package
(be sure to check out the LICENSE file) so that users don't have to
separately download and install it before installing your software
(after all, PLPA is a tiny little project -- why make users bother
with it?).

When used in "included" mode, PLPA will:

- not install any header files
- not build or install plpa-info or plpa-taskset
- not build libplpa.* -- instead, it will build libplpa_included.*

There are two ways to put PLPA into "included" mode.  From the
configure command line:

shell$ ./configure --enable-included-mode ...

Or by directly integrating PLPA's m4 configure macro in your configure
script and invoking a specific macro to enable the included mode.  

Every project is different, and there are many different ways of
integrating PLPA into yours.  What follows is *one* example of how to
do it.

Copy the PLPA directory in your source tree and include the plpa.m4
file in your configure script -- perhaps with the following line in
acinclude.m4 (assuming the use of Automake):

m4_include(path/to/plpa.m4)

The following macros can then be used from your configure script:

- PLPA_STANDALONE
  Force the building of PLPA in standalone mode.  Overrides the
  --enable-included-mode command line switch.

- PLPA_INCLUDED
  Force the building of PLPA in included mode.

- PLPA_SET_SYMBOL_PREFIX(foo)
  Tells the PLPA to prefix all types and public symbols with "foo"
  instead of "plpa_".  This is recommended behavior if you are
  including PLPA in a larger project -- it is possible that your
  software will be combined with other software that also includes
  PLPA.  If you both use different symbol prefixes, there will be no
  type/symbol clashes, and everything will compile and link
  successfully.  If you both include PLPA and do not change the symbol
  prefix, it is likely that you will get multiple symbol definitions
  when linking if an external PLPA is linked against your library /
  application.  Note that the PLPA_CPU_*() macros are *NOT* prefixed
  (because they are only used when compiling and therefore present no
  link/run-time conflicts), but all other types, enum values, and
  symbols are.  Enum values are prefixed with an upper-case
  translation if the prefix supplied.  For example,
  PLPA_SET_SYMBOL_PREFIX(foo_) will result in foo_init() and
  FOO_PROBE_OK.  Tip: It might be good to include "plpa" in the
  prefix, just for clarity.

- PLPA_DISABLE_EXECUTABLES
  Provides the same result as the --disable-executables configure
  flag, and is implicit in included mode.

- PLPA_INIT(action-upon-success, action-upon-failure)
  Invoke the PLPA tests and setup the PLPA to build.  A traversal of
  "make" into the PLPA directory should build everything (it is safe
  to list the PLPA directory in the SUBDIRS of a higher-level
  Makefile.am, for example).  PLPA_INIT must be invoked after the
  INCLUDED / STANDALONE / SET_SYMBOL_PREFIX macros.

- PLPA_DO_AM_CONDITIONALS
  If you embed PLPA in a larger project and build it conditionally
  (e.g., if PLPA_INIT is in a conditional), you must unconditionally
  invoke PLPA_DO_AM_CONDITIONALS to avoid warnings from Automake (for
  the cases where PLPA is not selected to be built).  This macro is
  necessary because PLPA uses some AM_CONDITIONALs to build itself;
  AM_CONDITIONALs cannot be defined conditionally.  It is safe (but
  unnecessary) to call PLPA_DO_AM_CONDITIONALS even if PLPA_INIT is
  invoked unconditionally.

Here's an example of integrating with a larger project named sandbox:

shell$ cd sandbox
shell$ cp -r /somewhere/else/plpa-<version> .
shell$ edit acinclude.m4
...add the line "m4_include(plpa-<version>/config/plpa.m4)"...
shell$ edit Makefile.am
...add "plpa-<version>" to SUBDIRS...
...add "$(top_builddir)/plpa-<version>/src/libplpa/libplpa_included.la" to
   my executable's LDADD line...
shell$ edit configure.ac
...add "PLPA_INCLUDED" line...
...add "PLPA_SET_SYMBOL_PREFIX(sandbox_plpa_)" line...
...add "PLPA_INIT(plpa_happy=yes, plpa_happy=no)" line...
...add error checking for plpa_happy=no case...
shell$ edit src/my_program.c
...add #include <plpa.h>...
...add calls to sandbox_plpa_sched_setaffinity()...
shell$ aclocal
shell$ autoconf
shell$ libtoolize --automake
shell$ automake -a
shell$ ./configure
...lots of output...
shell$ make
...lots of output...

===========================================================================

How can I tell if PLPA is working?
----------------------------------

Run plpa-info; if it says "Kernel affinity support: yes", then PLPA is
working properly.

If you want to compile your own test program to verify it, try
compiling and running the following:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#include <stdio.h>
#include <plpa.h>

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    plpa_api_type_t p;
    if (0 == plpa_api_probe(&p) && PLPA_PROBE_OK == p) {
        printf("All is good!\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

You may need to supply appropriate -I and -L arguments to the
compiler/linker, respectively, to tell it where to find the PLPA
header and library files.  Also don't forget to supply -lplpa to link
in the PLPA library itself.  For example, if you configured PLPA with:

shell$ ./configure --prefix=$HOME/my-plpa-install

Then you would compile the above program with:

shell$ gcc my-plpa-test.c \
       -I$HOME/my-plpa-install/include \
       -L$HOME/my-plpa-install/lib -lplpa \
       -o my-plpa-test
shell$ ./my-plpa-test

If it compiles, links, runs, and prints "All is good!", then all
should be well.

===========================================================================

What license does PLPA use?
---------------------------

This package is distributed under the BSD license (see the LICENSE
file in the top-level directory of a PLPA distribution).  The
copyrights of several institutions appear throughout the code base
because some of the code was directly derived from the Open MPI
project (http://www.open-mpi.org/), which is also distributed under
the BSD license.

===========================================================================

How do I get involved in PLPA?
------------------------------

Hopefully, PLPA is so simple that it won't need to be modified much
after its first few releases.  However, it is possible that we'll need
to modify the run-time test if new variants of the Linux processor
affinity API emerge.
