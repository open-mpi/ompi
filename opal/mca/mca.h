/**
 * @file
 *
 * Top-level interface for \em all MCA components.
 *
 * Historical notes:
 *
 * Open MPI originally used a v1.0.0 of the MCA component structs, but
 * did not have a version number in the struct name.  If I recall
 * correctly, this is because we simply didn't think through (or never
 * envisioned) changing the MCA base component struct itself.  Oops.
 *
 * We made some changes in the base struct in Open MPI v1.3, and
 * decided the following at the same time:
 *
 * - Bump the MCA version number to 2.0.0 and add some "reserved"
 *   space at the end of the struct.
 * - The major MCA version number is essentially tied to the space
 *   that the struct occupies; if we make future changes in the struct
 *   by just using some of the reserved space, it may be possible to
 *   just increment the minor version number (depending on the scope of
 *   the change).  If we need to add more space to the struct, we'll
 *   increment the major version number.
 * - The MCA base component struct now has a version number in it
 *   (starting with Open MPI v1.3, it is 2.0.0).
 * - As was an unstated assumption in prior versions of Open MPI, the
 *   unversioned versions of struct names (both in the MCA base and in
 *   individual framework bases) are intended for components who want
 *   to be forward source-compatible.  That is, the unversioned struct
 *   name always represents the most recent interface version.  If you
 *   need to use an older version, you can explicitly use that older
 *   struct version name.  Please note, however, the Open MPI
 *   developers may not generally provide older versions of framework
 *   interface structs unless they know if someone outside of the Open
 *   MPI community needs it.
 *
 *   ***IF YOU NEED BACKWARDS SOURCE OR BINARY COMPATIBILITY, you must
 *   let us know!***
 *
 * - We are currently only aware of one external developer making Open
 *   MPI components for the v1.2 series.  He already knows that there
 *   are major changes coming in the v1.3 series, and does not expect to
 *   be able to use his v1.2 DSO binaries in v1.3.  As such, we are
 *   breaking backwards binary compatibility in v1.3: there is no
 *   possibility of loading an MCA v1.0 binary component in Open MPI
 *   v1.3 or beyond (source compatibility is much easier -- the binary
 *   "refuse to load MCA components <v2.0.0" policy is enforced in
 *   mca_base_component_find.c).
 *
 *   ***IF YOU NEED BACKWARDS BINARY COMPATIBILITY, please let us
 *   know!***
 *
 * - Note that we decided that framework version numbers are *not*
 *   related to the MCA version number.  It is permissible to bump the
 *   MCA version number and leave all the framework version numbers
 *   they same.  Specifically: a component is uniquely identified by
 *   its (MCA version, framework version, component version) tuple.
 *   So a component that is simply compiled with two different MCA
 *   base versions is still considered "different" because the tuple
 *   first member is different.
 * - Per the discussion above, we decided to have MCA v2.0 no longer
 *   load <v2.0.0 components, and therefore avoided the "how to upcast
 *   a component in memory" issue.  After v2.0.0, it is slightly
 *   easier because the MCA component structs have "reserved" space at
 *   the end that may account for future version data fields.

 *
 * All MCA components can have an "open" function that is invoked once

 * This function should avoid registering MCA parameters (use the

 *
 * If a component has a non-NULL parameter registration function, it
 * will be invoked to register all MCA parameters associated with the
 * component.  This function is invoked *before* the component "open"
 * function is invoked.
 *
 * The registration function should not allocate any resources that
 * need to be freed (aside from registering MCA parameters).
 * Specifically, strings that are passed to the MCA parameter
 * registration functions are all internally copied; there's no need
 * for the caller to keep them after registering a parameter.  Hence,
 * it is possible that the registration function will be the *only*
 * function invoked on a component; component authors should take care
 * that no resources are leaked in this case.
 *
 * This function should return OPAL_SUCCESS if it wishes to remain
 * loaded in the process.  Any other return value will cause the MCA
 * base to unload the component.  Although most components do not use
 * this mechanism to force themselves to be unloaded (because if they
 * are immediately unloaded, ompi_info will not display them), the
 * mechanism is available should the need arise.
 *
 * Note that if the function returns OPAL_ERR_BAD_PARAM, it is
 * possible (likely?) that the component didn't register all of its
 * parameters.  When this happens, ompi_info (and friends) will stop
 * execution and print out all existing registered parameters from the
 * entire framework (since ompi_info doesn't track individual
 * component register failures).  This allows a user to know exactly
 * what value is incorrect, and from where it was set (e.g., via an
 * MCA params file).
 *
 * If the component a) has no MCA parameters to register, b) no
 * resources to allocate, and c) can always be used in a process
 * (albiet perhaps not selected), it may provide NULL for this
 * function.  In this cause, the MCA will act as if it called the
