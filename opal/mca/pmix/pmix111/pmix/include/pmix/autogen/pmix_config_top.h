/* The only purpose of this file is to undef the PACKAGE_<foo> macros
   that are put in by autoconf/automake projects.  Specifically, if
   you include a .h file from another project that defines these
   macros (e.g., gmp.h) and then include PMIX's config.h,
   you'll get a preprocessor conflict.  So put these undef's here to
   protect us from other package's PACKAGE_<foo> macros.

   Note that we can't put them directly in pmix_config.h (e.g., via
   AH_TOP) because they will be turned into #define's by autoconf. */
