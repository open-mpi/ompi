/** @file:
 * Creates a directory tree set to the specified permissions.
 *
 * The pmix_os_dirpath_create() function creates a directory
 * tree, with each directory that is created in the tree having the specified
 * access permissions. Existing directories within the tree are left
 * untouched - however, if they do not permit the user to create a directory
 * within them, the function will return an error condition.
 *
 * If the specified full path name already exists, the
 * pmix_os_dirpath_create() function will check to ensure that
 * the final directory in the tree has at least the specified access permission. In other
 * words, if the directory has read-write-execute for all, and the user
 * has requested read-write access for just the user, then the function
 * will consider the directory acceptable. If the minimal permissions are
 * not currently provided, the function will attempt to change the
 * access permissions of the directory to add the specified
 * permissions. The function will return PMIX_ERROR if this cannot
 * be done.
