$HEADER$

===========================================================================

This is where bindings of PMIx functions to alternative programming languages
such as Python reside. All functions defined in the public headers have been
provided with a wrapper. Note that there is no restriction on the number of
wrappers that can exist, nor on what type of function is wrapped.

There is only one rule to observe: you can wrap a framework, but you cannot wrap a
specific plugin within that framework. This constraint flows from the fact that
plugins are only accessed via the framework interface - thus, there is no way to
guarantee that a particular plugin will be the active selection.
