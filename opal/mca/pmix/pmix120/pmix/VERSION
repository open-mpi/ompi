# it will be appended to the version number.  It does not have to be
# numeric.  Common examples include a1 (alpha release 1), b1 or (beta release 1).
# The only requirement is that it must be entirely printable ASCII
# characters and have no white space.

greek=a1

# If repo_rev is empty, then the repository version number will be
# obtained during "make dist" via the "git describe --tags --always"
# command, or with the date (if "git describe" fails) in the form of
# "date<date>".

# If tarball_version is not empty, it is used as the version string in
# the tarball filename, regardless of all other versions listed in
# this file.  For example, if tarball_version is empty, the tarball
# filename will be of the form
# openmpi-<major>.<minor>.<release><greek>.tar.*.  However, if
# tarball_version is not empty, the tarball filename will be of the
# form openmpi-<tarball_version>.tar.*.

# These versions are maintained in accordance with the "Library
# Interface Versions" chapter from the GNU Libtool documentation.
# All changes in these version numbers are dictated by the PMIx
# release managers (not individual developers).  Notes:

# format.
