For More Information
====================

This file is a *very* short overview of building and installing
the PMIx library.  Much more information is available on the
PMIx web site (e.g., see the FAQ section):

    http://pmix.github.io/pmix/master


Developer Builds
================

If you have checked out a DEVELOPER'S COPY of PMIx (i.e., you checked
out from Git), you should read the HACKING file before attempting to
build PMIx.  You must then run:

shell$ ./autogen.sh

You will need very recent versions of GNU Autoconf, Automake, and
Libtool.  If autogen.sh fails, read the HACKING file.  If anything
else fails, read the HACKING file.  Finally, we suggest reading the
HACKING file.

*** NOTE: Developer's copies of PMIx typically include a large
performance penalty at run-time because of extra debugging overhead.


User Builds
===========

Building PMIx is typically a combination of running "configure"
and "make".  Execute the following commands to install the PMIx
system from within the directory at the top of the tree:

shell$ ./configure --prefix=/where/to/install
[...lots of output...]
shell$ make all install

If you need special access to install, then you can execute "make
all" as a user with write permissions in the build tree, and a
separate "make install" as a user with write permissions to the
install tree.

Compiling support for specific compilers and environments may
require additional command line flags when running configure.  See the
README file for more details.  Note that VPATH builds are fully
supported.  For example:

shell$ gtar zxf pmix-X.Y.Z.tar.gz
shell$ cd pmix-X.Y.Z
shell$ mkdir build
shell$ cd build
shell$ ../configure ...your options...
[...lots of output...]
shell$ make all install

Parallel builds are also supported (although some versions of "make",
such as GNU make, will only use the first target listed on the command
line when executable parallel builds).  For example (assume GNU make):

shell$ make -j 4 all
[...lots of output...]
shell$ make install

Parallel make is generally only helpful in the build phase; the
installation process is mostly serial and does not benefit much from
parallel make.
