/** @file
 * PMIX output stream facility.
 *
 * The PMIX output stream facility is used to send output from the PMIX
 * libraries to output devices.  It is meant to fully replace all
 * forms of printf() (and friends).  Output streams are opened via the
 * pmix_output_open() function call, and then sent output via
 * pmix_output_verbose(), PMIX_OUTPUT(), and pmix_output().  Streams are
 * closed with pmix_output_close().
 *
 * Streams can multiplex output to several kinds of outputs (one of
 * each):
 *
 * - the syslog (if available)
 * - standard output
 * - standard error
 * - file
 *
 * Which outputs to use are specified during pmix_output_open().
 *
 * WARNING: When using "file" as an output destination, be aware that
 * the file may not exist until the session directory for the process
 * exists.  This is at least part of the way through MPI_INIT (for
 * example).  Most MCA components and internals of PMIx won't be
 * affected by this, but some RTE / startup aspects of PMIx will
 * not be able to write to a file for output.  See pmix_output() for
 * details on what happens in these cases.
 *
 * pmix_output_open() returns an integer handle that is used in
 * successive calls to PMIX_OUTPUT() and pmix_output() to send output to
 * the stream.
 *
 * The default "verbose" stream is opened after invoking
 * pmix_output_init() (and closed after invoking
 * pmix_output_finalize()).  This stream outputs to stderr only, and
 * has a stream handle ID of 0.
 *
 * It is erroneous to have one thread close a stream and have another
 * try to write to it.  Multiple threads writing to a single stream
 * will be serialized in an unspecified order.

 *                        output sent to syslog at that priority
 * PMIX_OUTPUT_SYSLOG_IDENT - a string identifier for the log
 *
 * We also define two global variables that notify all other
 * layers that output is being redirected to syslog at the given
 * priority. These are used, for example, by the IO forwarding
 * subsystem to tell it to dump any collected output directly to
 * syslog instead of forwarding it to another location.
