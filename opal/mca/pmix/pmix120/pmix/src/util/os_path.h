/** @file:
 * Creates an operating system-acceptable path name.
 *
 * The pmix_os_path() function takes a variable number of string arguments and
 * concatenates them into a path name using the path separator character appropriate
 * to the local operating system. NOTE: the string returned by this function has been
 * malloc'd - thus, the user is responsible for free'ing the memory used by
 * the string.
 *
 * CRITICAL NOTE: The input variable list MUST be terminated by a NULL value. Failure
 * to do this will cause the program to suffer a catastrophic failure - usually a
 * segmentation violation or bus error.
 *
 * The function calls orte_sys_info() to ensure that the path separator character
 * has been identified. If that value cannot be identified for some reason,
 * the function will return a NULL value. Likewise, specifying a path name that
 * exceeds the maximum allowable path name length on the local system will result
 * in the return of a NULL value.
