===========================================================================

This file contains the main features as well as overviews of specific
bug fixes (and other actions) for each version of PMIx since
version 1.0.

As more fully described in the "Software Version Number" section in
the README file, PMIx typically maintains two separate version
series simultaneously - the current release and one that is locked
to only bug fixes.  Since these series are semi-independent of each
other, a single NEWS-worthy item might apply to different series. For
example, a bug might be fixed in the master, and then moved to the
current release as well as the "stable" bug fix release branch.


Master (not on release branches yet)
------------------------------------

1.1.5
-----
- Add pmix_version.h to support direct detection of PMIx library version
- Fix support for Solaris 10 by using abstract version of strnlen
- Fix native security module for Solaris by using getpeerucred in
  that environment
- Ensure man pages don't get installed in embedded builds
- Pass temporary directory locations in info keys instead of
  the environment

1.1.4
-----
- Properly increment the reference count for PMIx_Init
- Fix examples so all run properly
- Fix/complete PMI2 backward compatibility support to handle
  keys that are not associated with a specific rank

- Correct handling of semi-colon terminations on macros.
  Thanks to Ashley Pittman for the patch
- Add more man pages
- Improve error checking and messages for connection
  attempts from client to server

  help message to the user (particularly relevant on
  Mac OSX). Thanks to Rainer Keller for the patch.

  requested to do so
- Add support for multiple calls to Put/Commit


1.1.3

  the Makefiles are automatically built and the
  code compiled, but not installed
- Do not install the pmix library in embedded use-cases

  don't pass any topology info down to the client as it
  won't know how to unpack it anyway.

    * PMIx_Init(NULL) is supported
    * Incomplete PMIx_constants man page had some lingering cruft
    * Missing prototype for pmix_value_load

- Fix double-free error in pmix_server_commit.
- Fix PMIX_LOAD_BUFFER to be safe.
