.SH OVERVIEW
.PP
The Process Management Interface (PMI) has been used for quite some time
as a means of exchanging wireup information needed for interprocess
communication.
Two versions (PMI\-1 and PMI\-2) have been released as part of the MPICH
effort.
While PMI\-2 demonstrates better scaling properties than its PMI\-1
predecessor, attaining rapid launch and wireup of the roughly 1M
processes executing across 100k nodes expected for exascale operations
remains challenging.
.PP
PMI Exascale (PMIx) represents an attempt to resolve these questions by
providing an extended version of the PMI standard specifically designed
to support clusters up to and including exascale sizes.
The overall objective of the project is not to branch the existing
pseudo\-standard definitions \- in fact, PMIx fully supports both of the
existing PMI\-1 and PMI\-2 APIs \- but rather to (a) augment and extend
those APIs to eliminate some current restrictions that impact
scalability, and (b) provide a reference implementation of the
PMI\-server that demonstrates the desired level of scalability.
