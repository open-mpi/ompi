===========================================================================

This file contains the main features as well as overviews of specific
bug fixes (and other actions) for each version of PMIx since
version 1.0.

As more fully described in the "Software Version Number" section in
the README file, PMIx typically maintains two separate version
series simultaneously - the current release and one that is locked
to only bug fixes.  Since these series are semi-independent of each
other, a single NEWS-worthy item might apply to different series. For
example, a bug might be fixed in the master, and then moved to the
current release as well as the "stable" bug fix release branch.


Master (not on release branches yet)
------------------------------------

1.1.4
-----
- Properly increment the reference count for PMIx_Init
- Fix examples so all run properly
- Fix/complete PMI2 backward compatibility support to handle
  keys that are not associated with a specific rank
- Do a better job of hiding non-API symbols
- Correct handling of semi-colon terminations on macros.
  Thanks to Ashley Pittman for the patch
- Add more man pages
- Improve error checking and messages for connection
  attempts from client to server
- If the tmpdir name is too long, provide an appropriate
  help message to the user (particularly relevant on
  Mac OSX). Thanks to Rainer Keller for the patch.
- Fix some C++ compatibility issues
- Fix/complete PMI-1 backward compatibility support
- Do not install internal headers unless specifically
  requested to do so

  to Jim Garlick for pointing them out
- Resolve a race condition during register_clients


1.1.3
-----
- Update the symbol hiding file to cover all symbols

  the Makefiles are automatically built and the
  code compiled, but not installed
- Do not install the pmix library in embedded use-cases


1.1.2
-----
- Provide a check for hwloc support - if not found, then
  don't pass any topology info down to the client as it
  won't know how to unpack it anyway.
- Fix a few places where thread safety wasn't provided
- Fix several issues identified by Paul Hargrove:
    * PMIx_Init(NULL) is supported
    * Incomplete PMIx_constants man page had some lingering cruft
    * Missing prototype for pmix_value_load
- Fix race condition in PMIx_Get/PMIx_Get_nb
- Fix double-free error in pmix_server_commit.
- Fix PMIX_LOAD_BUFFER to be safe.

  were incorrectly being installed. Thanks to Orion
  Poplawski for reporting it

- major update of APIs to reflect comments received from 1.0.0
  non-production release
- fixed thread-safety issues
