/* The overall objective of this framework is to provide transport
 * options by which a server can communicate with a client:
 *
 * (a) across different versions of the library - e.g., when the
 *     connection handshake changes.
 *
 * (b) using different transports as necessitated by different
 *     environments.
 *
 * This is a mult-select framework - i.e., multiple components
 * are selected and "active" at the same time. The intent is
 * to have one component for each use-case, with the
 * expectation that the community will do its best not to revise
 * communications in manners that expand components to support (a).
 * Thus, new variations should be rare, and only a few components
 * will exist.
 *
 * The framework itself reflects the fact that any given peer
 * will utilize only one messaging method.
 * Thus, once a peer is identified, it will pass its version string
 * to this framework's "assign_module" function, which will then
 * pass it to each component until one returns a module capable of
 * processing the given version. This module is then "attached" to
 * the pmix_peer_t object so it can be used for all subsequent
 * communication to/from that peer.
 *
 * Accordingly, there are two levels of APIs defined for this
 * framework:
 *
 * (a) component level - these allow for init/finalize of the
 *     component, and assignment of a module to a given peer
 *     based on the version that peer is using
 *
 * (b) module level - implement send/recv/etc. Note that the
 *     module only needs to provide those functions that differ
 *     from the base functions - they don't need to duplicate
 *     all that code!
