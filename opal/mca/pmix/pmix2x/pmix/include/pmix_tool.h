 * PMIx provides a "function-shipping" approach to support for
 * implementing the server-side of the protocol. This method allows
 * resource managers to implement the server without being burdened
 * with PMIx internal details. Accordingly, each PMIx API is mirrored
 * here in a function call to be provided by the server. When a
 * request is received from the client, the corresponding server function
 * will be called with the information.
 *
 * Any functions not supported by the RM can be indicated by a NULL for
 * the function pointer. Client calls to such functions will have a
 * "not supported" error returned.

 * information of the local PMIx server and will establish the connection.
 * If the information is not found, or the server connection fails, then
 * an appropriate error constant will be returned.
 *
 * If successful, the function will return PMIX_SUCCESS and will fill the
 * provided structure with the server-assigned namespace and rank of the tool.
 *
 * Note that the PMIx tool library is referenced counted, and so multiple
 * calls to PMIx_tool_init are allowed. Thus, one way to obtain the namespace and
 * rank of the process is to simply call PMIx_tool_init with a non-NULL parameter.
 *
 * The info array is used to pass user requests pertaining to the init
 * and subsequent operations. Passing a _NULL_ value for the array pointer
