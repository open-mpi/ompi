===========================================================================

This file contains the main features as well as overviews of specific
bug fixes (and other actions) for each version of PMIx since
version 1.0.

As more fully described in the "Software Version Number" section in
the README file, PMIx typically maintains two separate version
series simultaneously - the current release and one that is locked
to only bug fixes.  Since these series are semi-independent of each
other, a single NEWS-worthy item might apply to different series. For
example, a bug might be fixed in the master, and then moved to the
current release as well as the "stable" bug fix release branch.

2.1.0 -- 1 Feb 2018
----------------------
**** NOTE: This release contains the first implementation of cross-version
**** support. Servers using v2.1.0 are capable of supporting clients using
**** PMIx versions v1.2 and above. Clients using v2.1.0 are able to interact
**** with servers based on v1.2 and above.
- Added cross-version communication support
- Enable reporting of contact URI to stdout, stderr, or file (PR #538)
- Enable support for remote tool connections (PR #540, #542)

- Debounce "unreachable" notifications for tools when they disconnect (PR #544)
- Enable the regex generator to support node names that include multiple
  sets of numbers


2.0.3 -- 1 Feb 2018
----------------------
- Fix event notification so all sides of multi-library get notified
  of other library's existence
- Update syslog protection to support Mac High Sierra OS

  to datatype differences
- Cleanup security handshake
- Cleanup separation of PMI-1/2 libraries and PMIx symbols
- Protect against overly-large messages
- Update data buffer APIs to support cross-version operations
- Protect receive callbacks from NULL and/or empty buffers as this
  can occur when the peer on a connection disappears.
- Fix tool connection search so it properly descends into the directory
  tree while searching for the server's contact file.
- Fix store_local so it doesn't reject a new nspace as that can happen
  when working with tools
- Ensure we always complete PMIx_Finalize - don't return if something
  goes wrong in the middle of the procedure

  operations to discover rendezvous files


2.0.0
------
**** NOTE: This release implements the complete PMIX v2.0 Standard
**** and therefore includes a number of new APIs and features. These
**** can be tracked by their RFC's in the RFC repository at:
**** https://github.com/pmix/RFCs. A formal standards document will
**** be included in a later v2.x release. Some of the changes are
**** identified below.
- Added the Modular Component Architecture (MCA) plugin manager and
  converted a number of operations to plugins, thereby allowing easy
  customization and extension (including proprietary offerings)
- Added support for TCP sockets instead of Unix domain sockets for
  client-server communications
- Added support for on-the-fly Allocation requests, including requests
  for additional resources, extension of time for currently allocated
  resources, and return of identified allocated resources to the scheduler
  (RFC 0005 - https://github.com/pmix/RFCs/blob/master/RFC0005.md)
- Tightened rules on the processing of PMIx_Get requests, including
  reservation of the "pmix" prefix for attribute keys and specifying
  behaviors associated with the PMIX_RANK_WILDCARD value
  (RFC 0009 - https://github.com/pmix/RFCs/blob/master/RFC0009.md)
- Extended support for tool interactions with a PMIx server aimed at
  meeting the needs of debuggers and other tools. Includes support
  for rendezvousing with a system-level PMIx server for interacting
  with the system management stack (SMS) outside of an allocated
  session, and adds two new APIs:
  - PMIx_Query: request general information such as the process
    table for a specified job, and available SMS capabilities
  - PMIx_Log: log messages (e.g., application progress) to a
    system-hosted persistent store
  (RFC 0010 - https://github.com/pmix/RFCs/blob/master/RFC0010.md)
- Added support for fabric/network interactions associated with
  "instant on" application startup
  (RFC 0012 - https://github.com/pmix/RFCs/blob/master/RFC0012.md)
- Added an attribute to support getting the time remaining in an
  allocation via the PMIx_Query interface
  (RFC 0013 - https://github.com/pmix/RFCs/blob/master/RFC0013.md)
- Added interfaces to support job control and monitoring requests,
  including heartbeat and file monitors to detect stalled applications.
  Job control interface supports standard signal-related operations
  (pause, kill, resume, etc.) as well as checkpoint/restart requests.
  The interface can also be used by an application to indicate it is
  willing to be pre-empted, with the host RM providing an event
  notification when the preemption is desired.
  (RFC 0015 - https://github.com/pmix/RFCs/blob/master/RFC0015.md)
- Extended the event notification system to support notifications
  across threads in the same process, and the ability to direct
  ordering of notifications when registering event handlers.
  (RFC 0018 - https://github.com/pmix/RFCs/blob/master/RFC0018.md)
- Expose the buffer manipulation functions via a new set of APIs
  to support heterogeneous data transfers within the host RM
  environment
  (RFC 0020 - https://github.com/pmix/RFCs/blob/master/RFC0020.md)
- Fix a number of race condition issues that arose at scale
- Enable PMIx servers to generate notifications to the host RM
  and to themselves
