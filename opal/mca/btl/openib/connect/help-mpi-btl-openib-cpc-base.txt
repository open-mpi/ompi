[no cpcs for port]
No OpenFabrics connection schemes reported that they were able to be
used on a specific port.  As such, the openib BTL (OpenFabrics
support) will be disabled for this port.

  Local host:           %s
  Local device:         %s
  Local port:           %d
  CPCs attempted:       %s
#
[cpc name not found]
An invalid CPC name was specified via the btl_openib_cpc_%s MCA 
parameter.

  Local host:                   %s
  btl_openib_cpc_%s value: %s
  Invalid name:                 %s
  All possible valid names:     %s
#
[inline truncated]
WARNING: The btl_openib_max_inline_data MCA parameter was used to
specify how much inline data should be used, but a device reduced this
value.  This is not an error; it simply means that your run will use
a smaller inline data value than was requested.

  Local host:           %s
  Local device:         %s
  Local port:           %d
  Requested value:      %d
  Value used by device: %d
#
[ibv_create_qp failed]
A process failed to create a queue pair. This usually means either
the device has run out of queue pairs (too many connections) or
there are insufficient resources available to allocate a queue pair
(out of memory). The latter can happen if either 1) insufficient
memory is available, or 2) no more physical memory can be registered
with the device.

For more information on memory registration see the Open MPI FAQs at:
http://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=openfabrics#ib-locked-pages
