# This is the US/English help file for Open MPI's OpenFabrics RDMA CM
# support (the openib BTL).
#
[could not find matching endpoint]
The OpenFabrics device in an MPI process received an RDMA CM connect
request for a peer that it could not identify as part of this MPI job.
This should not happen.  Your process is likely to abort; sorry.

  Local host:      %s
  Local device:    %s
  Remote address:  %s
  Remote TCP port: %d
#
[illegal tcp port]
The btl_openib_connect_rdmacm_port MCA parameter was used to specify
an illegal TCP port value.  TCP ports must be between 0 and 65536
(ports below 1024 can only be used by root).

  TCP port: %d

This value was ignored.
#
[illegal retry count]
The btl_openib_connect_rdmacm_retry_count MCA parameter was used to specify
an illegal retry count.

  Retry count: %d

#
[illegal timeout]
The btl_openib_connect_rdmacm_resolve_timeout parameter was used to
specify an illegal timeout value.  Timeout values are specified in
miliseconds and must be greater than 0.

  Timeout value: %d

This value was ignored.
#
[rdma cm device removal]
The RDMA CM returned that the device Open MPI was trying to use has
been removed.

  Local host: %s
  Local device: %s

Your MPI job will now abort, sorry.
#
[rdma cm event error]
The RDMA CM returned an event error while attempting to make a
connection.  This type of error usually indicates a network
configuration error.

  Local host:   %s
  Local device: %s
  Error name:   %s
  Peer:         %s

Your MPI job will now abort, sorry.
