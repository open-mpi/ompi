[client handshake fail]

[accept failed]
WARNING: The accept(3) system call failed on a TCP socket.  While this
should generally never happen on a well-configured HPC system, the
most common causes when it does occur are:

  * The process ran out of file descriptors
  * The operating system ran out of file descriptors
  * The operating system ran out of memory

Your Open MPI job will likely hang (or crash) until the failure
resason is fixed (e.g., more file descriptors and/or memory becomes
available), and may eventually timeout / abort.

#
[peer hung up]
An MPI communication peer process has unexpectedly disconnected.  This
usually indicates a failure in the peer process (e.g., a crash or
otherwise exiting without calling MPI_FINALIZE first).

Although this local MPI process will likely now behave unpredictably
(it may even hang or crash), the root cause of this problem is the
failure of the peer -- that is what you need to investigate.  For
example, there may be a core file that you can examine.  More
generally: such peer hangups are frequently caused by application bugs
or other external events.

[dropped inbound connection]
Open MPI detected an inbound MPI TCP connection request from a peer
that appears to be part of this MPI job (i.e., it identified itself as
part of this Open MPI job), but it is from an IP address that is
unexpected.  This is highly unusual.

The inbound connection has been dropped, and the peer should simply
try again with a different IP interface (i.e., the job should
hopefully be able to continue).

[socket flag fail]
WARNING: Open MPI failed to get or set flags on a TCP socket.  This
should not happen.

This may cause unpredictable behavior, and may end up hanging or
aborting your job.

[server did not get guid]
WARNING: Open MPI accepted a TCP connection from what appears to be a
another Open MPI process but the peer process did not complete the
initial handshake properly.  This should not happen.

This attempted connection will be ignored; your MPI job may or may not
continue properly.

continue properly.

[did not receive full magic id string]
The TCP BTL received an inbound socket connection from an unidentified
peer.  This typically means one of two things:

1. A non-Open MPI process tried to connect to this Open MPI process.
2. An Open MPI process compiled against a different version of Open
   MPI tried to connect to this Open MPI process.

Open MPI only supports running exactly the same version between all
processes in a single job.

This may cause unpredictable behavior, and may end up aborting your
job.

#
[received incorrect magic id string]
The TCP BTL received an inbound socket connection from a peer that did
not identify itself correctly as an Open MPI process. This typically
means one of two things:

1. A non-Open MPI process tried to connect to this Open MPI process.
2. An Open MPI process compiled against a different version of Open
   MPI tried to connect to this Open MPI process.

Open MPI only supports running exactly the same version between all
processes in a single job.

This may cause unpredictable behavior, and may end up hanging or
aborting your job.
