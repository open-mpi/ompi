[invalid if_inexclude]

value will be ignored.

[invalid minimum port]
WARNING: An invalid value was given for the btl_tcp_port_min_%s. Legal
values are in the range [1 .. 2^16-1]. This value will be ignored
(reset to the default value of 1024).

[client connect fail]
WARNING: Open MPI failed to TCP connect to a peer MPI process.  This
should not happen.

Your Open MPI job may now hang or fail.

[client handshake fail]
WARNING: Open MPI failed to handshake with a connecting peer MPI
process over TCP.  This should not happen.

Your Open MPI job may now hang or fail.

  Message:    %s

[accept failed]
WARNING: The accept(3) system call failed on a TCP socket.  While this
should generally never happen on a well-configured HPC system, the
most common causes when it does occur are:

  * The process ran out of file descriptors
  * The operating system ran out of file descriptors
  * The operating system ran out of memory

Your Open MPI job will likely hang (or crash) until the failure
resason is fixed (e.g., more file descriptors and/or memory becomes
available), and may eventually timeout / abort.

  PID:        %d
  Errno:      %d (%s)
#
[peer hung up]
An MPI communication peer process has unexpectedly disconnected.  This
usually indicates a failure in the peer process (e.g., a crash or
otherwise exiting without calling MPI_FINALIZE first).

Although this local MPI process will likely now behave unpredictably
(it may even hang or crash), the root cause of this problem is the
failure of the peer -- that is what you need to investigate.  For
example, there may be a core file that you can examine.  More
generally: such peer hangups are frequently caused by application bugs
or other external events.

[dropped inbound connection]
Open MPI detected an inbound MPI TCP connection request from a peer
that appears to be part of this MPI job (i.e., it identified itself as
part of this Open MPI job), but it is from an IP address that is
unexpected.  This is highly unusual.

The inbound connection has been dropped, and the peer should simply
try again with a different IP interface (i.e., the job should
hopefully be able to continue).

[socket flag fail]
WARNING: Open MPI failed to get or set flags on a TCP socket.  This
should not happen.

This may cause unpredictable behavior, and may end up hanging or
aborting your job.

[server accept cannot find guid]
WARNING: Open MPI accepted a TCP connection from what appears to be a
another Open MPI process but cannot find a corresponding process
entry for that peer.

This attempted connection will be ignored; your MPI job may or may not
continue properly.

  PID:        %d
#
[server getpeername failed]
WARNING: Open MPI failed to look up the peer IP address information of
a TCP connection that it just accepted.  This should not happen.

This attempted connection will be ignored; your MPI job may or may not
continue properly.

  PID:        %d
  Error:      %s (%d)
#
[server did not receive magic string]
WARNING: Open MPI accepted a TCP connection but did not receive the
expected network identification indicating that the peer is an Open
MPI process.

This attempted connection will be closed and ignored.
