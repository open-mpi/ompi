.
opal-checkpoint \- Checkpoint a running sequential process using the Open PAL
Checkpoint/Restart Service (CRS).
.
.P
\fBNote\fR: This should only be used by the user if the application being
checkpointed is an OPAL-only application. If it is an Open RTE or Open MPI
program their respective tools should be used.

.
\fIopal-checkpoint\fR will attempt to notify a running process that it has been
requested that the process checkpoint itself. A snapshot handle reference is
presented to the user, which is used in \fIopal_restart\fP to restart the
process.
.

.B <PID>
Process ID of the running target process.

.B -gmca | --gmca \fR<key> <value>\fP
Pass global MCA parameters that are applicable to all contexts. \fI<key>\fP is
the parameter name; \fI<value>\fP is the parameter value.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.
.PP
\fIopal-checkpoint\fR can be invoked multiple, non-overlapping times. This
allows the user to take involuntary checkpoints of a running sequential
process. See opal_crs(7) for more information about the CRS framework and
components. It is convenient to note that the user does not need to spectify
the checkpointer to be used here, as that is determined completely by the
running process being checkpointed.
