/**
 * Check and see if the process is using multiple threads.

 * @retval true If the process may have more than one thread.

 *
 * The value that this function returns is influenced by:
 *
 * - how MPI_INIT or MPI_INIT_THREAD was invoked,
 * - what the final MPI thread level was determined to be,
 * - whether the OMPI or MPI libraries are multi-threaded (Jan 2003:
 *   they're not),
 * - whether configure determined if we have thread support or not
 *
 * MPI_INIT and MPI_INIT_THREAD (specifically, back-end OMPI startup
 * functions) invoke opal_set_using_threads() to influence the value of
 * this function, depending on their situation. Some examples:
 *
 * - if configure determined that we do not have threads, then this
 * value will always be false.
 *
 * - if MPI_INIT is invoked, and the ompi libraries are [still]
 * single-threaded, this value will be false.
 *
 * - if MPI_INIT_THREAD is invoked with MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE, we have
 * thread support, and the final thread level is determined to be
 * MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE, this value will be true.
 *
 * - if the process is a single-threaded OMPI executable (e.g., mpicc),
 * this value will be false.
 *
 * Hence, this function will return false if there is guaranteed to
 * only be one thread in the process.  If there is even the
 * possibility that we may have multiple threads, true will be
