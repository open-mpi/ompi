[stacktrace signal override]
Open MPI was inserting a signal handler for signal %d but noticed
that there is already a non-default handler installed.  Open MPI's
handler was therefore not installed; your job will continue.  This
warning message will only be displayed once, even if Open MPI
encounters this situation again.

To avoid displaying this warning message, you can either not install
the error handler for signal %d or you can have Open MPI not try to
install its own signal handler for this signal by setting the
"opal_signals" MCA parameter.

  Signal: %d
  Current opal_signal value: %s
#
[stacktrace bad signal]
Open MPI was inserting a signal handler but was given an invalid
signal number:

  Signal string: %s
  Bad value:     %s

The given value must be an integer within the signal number
range. Please correct the value and try again.
#
[malformed net_private_ipv4]
Open MPI has detected at least one malformed IP address or netmask in
the value of the opal_net_private_ipv4 MCA parameter.  The
opal_net_private_ipv4 MCA parameter accepts a semicolon-delimited list
of Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation specifications, each
of the form <ipaddress>/<mask>.  For example:

     10.0.0.0/8;172.16.0.0/12;192.168.0.0/16;169.254.0.0/16

The first detected malformed entry was %s.
#
[invalid-net-mask]
Open MPI has detected a malformed IPv4 address or netmask:

  Value provided: %s

Accepted values follow the Classless Inter-Domain
Routing (CIDR) notation specifications. For example:

     10.0.0.0/8
     172.16/12
     192.168
     169.254.0.0/16
#
[malformed-uri]
Open MPI has detected a malformed URI:

  URI:  %s

Accepted values follow IETF RFC3986, e.g. file://192.168.1.1/over/there
#
[relative-path]
When creating a URI, all files must be specified in absolute paths:

  Value provided: %s

Please update your application to provide the full path to the file.
#
[sys-limit-failed]
Per request, Open MPI attempted to set a system resource
limit to a given value:

  Resource:  %s
  Limit:     %s

The system has refused to allow this operation. This is likely
due to a permission limitation, or specifying an unsupported
value. Please check the system or remove the request and try
again.
#
[sys-limit-unrecognized]
Open MPI received a request to set a system resource limit.
Sadly, OMPI does not recognize or currently support the specified
resource:

  Resource:  %s
  Limit:     %s

Please correct the request and try again.
#
[dir-mode]
While working through a directory tree, we were unable to set
a directory to the desired mode:

  Directory:  %s
  Mode:       %0x
  Error:      %s

Please check to ensure you have adequate permissions to perform
the desired operation.
#
[mkdir-failed]
A call to mkdir was unable to create the desired directory:

  Directory: %s
  Error:     %s

Please check to ensure you have adequate permissions to perform
the desired operation.
