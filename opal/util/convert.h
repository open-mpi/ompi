/** 
 * @file
 *
 * This file will hopefully not last long in the tree, but it's
 * unfortunately necessary for now.
 *
 * There are multiple places in the code base where we need to safely
 * convert from a size_t to an int.  However, on some platforms,
 * sizeof(size_t) is larger than sizeof(int), so casting from size_t
 * -> int will result in a compiler warning and potentially data
 * truncation.
 *
 * But, unfortunately, we still need to do it.  But we definitely do
 * not want compiler warnings.  So when sizeof(size_t)>sizeof(int),
 * the solution is the treat the size_t value like an array and
 * dereference the appropriate nibble and cast that to an int (which
 * accounts for both big and little endian machines).
 *
 * Most places in the code where this casting must occur are because
 * collision of APIs (e.g., one API requires a size_t and another API
 * requires an int.  And in most places, we're not going to overflow
 * the int when casting down into it (e.g., it's the result of a
 * strlen -- if that buffer is larger than MAX_INT, we've got other problems!).
 *
 * BUT -- the whole premise of casting down to an int is dangerous.
 * So we provide extra protection here to detect overflow situations
 * and print out appropriate warnings.  So if this situation ever
 * occurs, we'll still overflow, but we'll have a good indication that
 * it's happening, and where.
