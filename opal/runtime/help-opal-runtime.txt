[opal_init:startup:internal-failure]
It looks like opal_init failed for some reason; your parallel process is
likely to abort.  There are many reasons that a parallel process can
fail during opal_init; some of which are due to configuration or
environment problems.  This failure appears to be an internal failure;
here's some additional information (which may only be relevant to an
Open MPI developer):

  %s failed
  --> Returned value %d instead of OPAL_SUCCESS
#
# Just want a clean printout for sys limit as the
# message was already generated by show-help
[opal_init:syslimit]
%s
#
[opal_init:warn-fork]
A process has executed an operation involving a call to the
"fork()" system call to create a child process.  Open MPI is currently
operating in a condition that could result in memory corruption or
other system errors; your job may hang, crash, or produce silent
data corruption.  The use of fork() (or system() or other calls that
create child processes) is strongly discouraged.

The process that invoked fork was:

  Local host:          %s (PID %d)

If you are *absolutely sure* that your application will successfully
and correctly survive a call to fork(), you may disable this warning
by setting the mpi_warn_on_fork MCA parameter to 0.

[mpi-params:leave-pinned-and-pipeline-selected]
WARNING: Cannot set both the MCA parameters opal_leave_pinned (a.k.a.,
mpi_leave_pinned) and opal_leave_pinned_pipeline (a.k.a.,
mpi_leave_pinned_pipeline) to "true".  Defaulting to mpi_leave_pinned
ONLY.
#
[mpi-params:var_dump_color:format-error]
WARNING: Token "%s" in opal_var_dump_color MCA parameter
is not in the expected "key=value" format, ignoring.
#
[mpi-params:var_dump_color:unknown-key]
WARNING: Key "%s" in opal_var_dump_color MCA parameter
token "%s" is unknown, ignoring.

  Valid keys are: %s
