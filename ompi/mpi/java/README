Note about the Open MPI Java bindings

The Java bindings in this directory are not part of the MPI specification,
as noted in the README.JAVA.txt file in the root directory. That file also
contains some information regarding the installation and use of the Java
bindings. Further details can be found in the paper [1].

We originally took the code from the mpiJava project [2] as starting point
for our developments, but we have pretty much rewritten 100% of it. The
original copyrights and license terms of mpiJava are listed below.
