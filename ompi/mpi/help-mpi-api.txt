# This is the US/English general help file for Open MPI.
#
[mpi-function-after-finalize]
Calling any MPI-function after calling MPI_Finalize is erroneous.
The only exceptions are MPI_Initialized, MPI_Finalized and MPI_Get_version.
#
[mpi-initialize-twice]
Calling MPI_Init or MPI_Init_thread twice is erroneous.
#
[mpi-abort]
MPI_ABORT was invoked on rank %d in communicator %s
with errorcode %d.

NOTE: invoking MPI_ABORT causes Open MPI to kill all MPI processes.
You may or may not see output from other processes, depending on
exactly when Open MPI kills them.
