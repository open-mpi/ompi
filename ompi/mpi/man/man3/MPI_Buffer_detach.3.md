# Name

MPI_Buffer_detach - Removes an existing buffer (for use in
in MPI_Bsend, etc.)

# Syntax

## C Syntax

```C
#include <mpi.h>

int MPI_Buffer_detach(void *buf, int *size)
```


## Fortran Syntax

```Fortran
USE MPI
! or the older form: INCLUDE 'mpif.h'

MPI_BUFFER_DETACH(BUF, SIZE, IERROR)
	<type>	BUF(*)
	INTEGER	SIZE, IERROR
```


## Fortran 2008 Syntax
 
```Fortran
USE mpi_f08

MPI_Buffer_detach(buffer_addr, size, ierror)
	USE, INTRINSIC :: ISO_C_BINDING, ONLY
	TYPE(C_PTR), INTENT(OUT) :: buffer_addr
	INTEGER, INTENT(OUT) :: size
	INTEGER, OPTIONAL, INTENT(OUT) :: ierror
```


# Output Parameters

* buf : Initial buffer address (choice).
* size : Buffer size, in bytes (integer).
* IERROR : Fortran only: Error status (integer).

# Description

Detach the buffer currently associated with MPI. The call returns the
address and the size of the detached buffer. This operation will block
until all messages currently in the buffer have been transmitted. Upon
return of this function, the user may reuse or deallocate the space
taken by the buffer.

Example: Calls to attach and detach buffers.
c
#define BUFFSIZE 10000

int size
char *buff;
MPI_Buffer_attach( malloc(BUFFSIZE), BUFFSIZE);
/* a buffer of 10000 bytes can now be used by MPI_Bsend */
MPI_Buffer_detach( &buff, &size);
/* Buffer size reduced to zero */
MPI_Buffer_attach( buff, size);
/* Buffer of 10000 bytes available again */


# Notes
The  reason  that  MPI_Buffer_detach  returns the address and size of
the buffer being detached is to allow nested libraries to replace and
restore the buffer. For example, consider
c
int size, mysize, idummy;
void *ptr, *myptr, *dummy;
MPI_Buffer_detach( &ptr, &size );
MPI_Buffer_attach( myptr, mysize );
/*
... library code ...
*/
MPI_Buffer_detach( &dummy, &idummy );
MPI_Buffer_attach( ptr, size );

This is much like the action of the UNIX signal routine and has the
same strengths (it's simple) and  weak‚Äênesses (it only works for
nested usages).

For Fortran: The Fortran binding for this routine is different.
Because Fortran does not have pointers, it is impossible to provide
a way to use the output of this routine to exchange buffers. In this
case, only the size field is set.

For C: Even though the buf argument is declared as void, it is really
the address of a void pointer. See Rationale, below, for more details.

Even though the C functions MPI_Buffer_attach and MPI_Buffer_detach
both have  a  first  argument  of  type void*,  these  arguments are
used differently: A pointer to the buffer is passed to MPI_Buffer_attach;
the address of the pointer is passed to MPI_Buffer_detach, so that this
call can return the pointer value.

# Errors

Almost all MPI routines return an error value; C routines as the value
of the function and Fortran routines in the last argument.

Before the error value is returned, the current MPI error handler is
called. By default, this error handler aborts the MPI job, except for
I/O function errors. The error handler may be changed with
MPI_Comm_set_errhandler; the predefined error handler MPI_ERRORS_RETURN
may be used to cause error values to be returned. Note that MPI does not
guarantee that an MPI program can continue past an error.
