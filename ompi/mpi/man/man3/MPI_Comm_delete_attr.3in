.SH DESCRIPTION
.ft R
MPI_Comm_delete_attr deletes an attribute from cache by key. This function invokes the attribute delete function delete_fn specified when the \fIcomm_keyval\fP was created. The call will fail if the delete_fn function returns an error code other than MPI_SUCCESS.  

Whenever a communicator is replicated using the function MPI_Comm_dup, all callback copy functions for attributes that are currently set are invoked (in arbitrary order). Whenever a communicator is deleted using the function MPI_Comm_free, all callback delete functions for attributes that are currently set are invoked. 
.sp
This function is the same as MPI_Attr_delete but is needed to match the communicator-specific functions introduced in the MPI-2 standard. The use of MPI_Attr_delete is deprecated. 


.SH NOTES
Note that it is not defined by the MPI standard what happens if the
delete_fn callback invokes other MPI functions.  In Open MPI, it is
not valid for delete_fn callbacks (or any of their children) to add or
delete attributes on the same object on which the delete_fn callback
is being invoked.


.SH ERRORS
Almost all MPI routines return an error value; C routines as the value of the function and Fortran routines in the last argument. C++ functions do not return errors. If the default error handler is set to MPI::ERRORS_THROW_EXCEPTIONS, then on error the C++ exception mechanism will be used to throw an MPI::Exception object.
.sp
Before the error value is returned, the current MPI error handler is
called. By default, this error handler aborts the MPI job, except for I/O function errors. The error handler may be changed with MPI_Comm_set_errhandler; the predefined error handler MPI_ERRORS_RETURN may be used to cause error values to be returned. Note that MPI does not guarantee that an MPI program can continue past an error.
