# Name

MPI_Session_finalize - releases all MPI state associated with a session

# Syntax

## C Syntax

```c
#include <mpi.h>

int MPI_Session_finalize(MPI_Session *session)
```


## Fortran Syntax

```fortran
USE MPI
! or the older form: INCLUDE 'mpif.h'

MPI_SESSION_FINALIZE(SESSION, IERROR)
    INTEGER	SESSION, IERROR
```


## Fortran 2008 Syntax

```fortran
USE mpi_f08

MPI_Session_finalize(session, ierror)
    TYPE(MPI_Session), INTENT(IN) :: session
    INTEGER, OPTIONAL, INTENT(OUT) :: ierror
```


# Input Parameters

* session : session to be finalized (handle)

# Output Parameters

* IERROR : Fortran only: Error status (integer).

# Description

MPI_Session_finalize releases all MPI state associated with the supplied session. Every instantiated
session must be finalized using MPI_Session_finalize. The handle session is set to
MPI_SESSION_NULL by the call.

# Notes

Before an MPI process invokes MPI_Session_finalize, the process must perform
all MPI calls needed to complete its involvement in MPI communications: it must locally
complete all MPI operations that it initiated and it must execute matching calls needed to
complete MPI communications initiated by other processes.  The call to MPI_Session_finalize does not free objects created by MPI calls; these
objects are freed using MPI_XXX_FREE calls.  MPI_Session_finalize may be synchronizing on any or all of the groups associated
with communicators, windows, or â€€les derived from the session and not disconnected, freed,
or closed, respectively, before the call to MPI_Session_finalize procedure.
MPI_Session_finalize behaves as if all such synchronizations occur concurrently. As
MPI_Comm_free may mark a communicator for freeing later, MPI_Session_finalize
may be synchronizing on the group associated with a communicator that is only freed (with
MPI_Comm_free) rather than disconnected (with MPI_Comm_disconnect).


# Errors

Almost all MPI routines return an error value; C routines as the value
of the function and Fortran routines in the last argument.
Before the error value is returned, the current MPI error handler is
called. By default, this error handler aborts the MPI job, except for
I/O function errors. The error handler may be changed with
MPI_Session_set_errhandler; the predefined error handler MPI_ERRORS_RETURN
may be used to cause error values to be returned. Note that MPI does not
guarantee that an MPI program can continue past an error.
