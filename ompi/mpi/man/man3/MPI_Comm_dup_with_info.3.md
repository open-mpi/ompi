# Name

MPI_Comm_dup_with_info - Duplicates an existing communicator using
provided info.

# Syntax

## C Syntax

```c
#include <mpi.h>

int MPI_Comm_dup_with_info(MPI_Comm comm, MPI_Info info, MPI_Comm *newcomm)
```


## Fortran Syntax

```fortran
USE MPI
! or the older form: INCLUDE 'mpif.h'

MPI_COMM_DUP_WITH_INFO(COMM, INFO, NEWCOMM, IERROR)
    INTEGER	COMM, INFO, NEWCOMM, IERROR
```


## Fortran 2008 Syntax

```fortran
USE mpi_f08

MPI_Comm_dup_with_info(comm, info, newcomm, ierror)
    TYPE(MPI_Comm), INTENT(IN) :: comm
    TYPE(MPI_Info), INTENT(IN) :: info
    TYPE(MPI_Comm), INTENT(OUT) :: newcomm
    INTEGER, OPTIONAL, INTENT(OUT) :: ierror
```


# Input Parameter

* comm : Communicator (handle).
* info : Info argument (handle).

# Output Parameters

* newcomm : Copy of comm (handle).
* IERROR : Fortran only: Error status (integer).

# Description

MPI_Comm_dup_with_info acts exactly like MPI_Comm_dup except that the
info hints associated with the communicator comm are not duplicated in
newcomm. The hints provided by the argument info are associated with
the output communicator newcomm instead.
See MPI_Comm_set_info(3) for the list of recognized info keys.

# Notes

This operation is used to provide a parallel library call with a
duplicate communication space that has the same properties as the
original communicator. This includes any attributes (see below) and
topologies (see Chapter 6, "Process Topologies," in the MPI-1
Standard). This call is valid even if there are pending point-to-point
communications involving the communicator comm. A typical call might
involve an MPI_Comm_dup_with_info at the beginning of the parallel call,
and an MPI_Comm_free of that duplicated communicator at the end of the
call. Other models of communicator management are also possible.
This call applies to both intra- and intercommunicators.
Note that it is not defined by the MPI standard what happens if the
attribute copy callback invokes other MPI functions. In Open MPI, it is
not valid for attribute copy callbacks (or any of their children) to add
or delete attributes on the same object on which the attribute copy
callback is being invoked.

# Errors

Almost all MPI routines return an error value; C routines as the value
of the function and Fortran routines in the last argument.
Before the error value is returned, the current MPI error handler is
called. By default, this error handler aborts the MPI job, except for
I/O function errors. The error handler may be changed with
MPI_Comm_set_errhandler; the predefined error handler MPI_ERRORS_RETURN
may be used to cause error values to be returned. Note that MPI does not
guarantee that an MPI program can continue past an error.
