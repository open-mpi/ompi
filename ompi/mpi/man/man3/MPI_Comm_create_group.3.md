# Name

MPI_Comm_create_group - Creates a new communicator.

# Syntax

## C Syntax

```C
#include <mpi.h>

int MPI_Comm_create_group(MPI_Comm comm, MPI_Group group, int tag, MPI_Comm *newcomm)
```


## Fortran Syntax

```Fortran
USE MPI
! or the older form: INCLUDE 'mpif.h'

MPI_COMM_CREATE_GROUP(COMM, GROUP, TAG, NEWCOMM, IERROR)
    INTEGER	COMM, GROUP, TAG, NEWCOMM, IERROR
```


## Fortran 2008 Syntax

```Fortran
USE mpi_f08

MPI_Comm_create_group(comm, group, tag, newcomm, ierror)
    TYPE(MPI_Comm), INTENT(IN) :: comm
    TYPE(MPI_Group), INTENT(IN) :: group
    INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: tag
    TYPE(MPI_Comm), INTENT(OUT) :: newcomm
    INTEGER, OPTIONAL, INTENT(OUT) :: ierror
```


# Input Parameters

* comm : Communicator (handle).
* group : Group, which is a subset of the group of comm (handle).
* tag : Tag (integer).

# Output Parameters

* newcomm : New communicator (handle).
* IERROR : Fortran only: Error status (integer).

# Description

MPI_Comm_create_group is similar to MPI_Comm_create; however,
MPI_Comm_create must be called by all processes in the group of comm,
whereas MPI_Comm_create_group must be called by all processes in group,
which is a subgroup of the group of comm. In addition,
MPI_Comm_create_group requires that comm is an intracommunicator.
MPI_Comm_create_group returns a new intracommunicator, newcomm, for
which the group argument defines the communication group. No cached
information propagates from comm to newcomm.
Each process must provide a group argument that is a subgroup of the
group associated with comm; this could be MPI_GROUP_EMPTY. If a
non-empty group is specified, then all processes in that group must call
the function, and each of these processes must provide the same
arguments, including a group that contains the same members with the
same ordering. Otherwise the call is erroneous. If the calling process
is a member of the group given as the group argument, then newcomm is
a communicator with group as its associated group. If the calling
process is not a member of group, e.g., group is MPI_GROUP_EMPTY, then
the call is a local operation and MPI_COMM_NULL is returned as
newcomm.

# Notes

MPI_Comm_create_group provides a means of making a subset of processes
for the purpose of separate MIMD computation, with separate
communication space. newcomm, which is created by
MPI_Comm_create_group, can be used in subsequent calls to
MPI_Comm_create_group (or other communicator constructors) to further
subdivide a computation into parallel sub-computations. A more general
service is provided by MPI_Comm_split.

# Errors

Almost all MPI routines return an error value; C routines as the value
of the function and Fortran routines in the last argument.
Before the error value is returned, the current MPI error handler is
called. By default, this error handler aborts the MPI job, except for
I/O function errors. The error handler may be changed with
MPI_Comm_set_errhandler; the predefined error handler MPI_ERRORS_RETURN
may be used to cause error values to be returned. Note that MPI does not
guarantee that an MPI program can continue past an error.
