.SH INPUT PARAMETERS
.ft R
.TP 1i
comm
Communicator to which attribute will be attached (handle).
.TP 1i
keyval
Key value, as returned by MPI_KEYVAL_CREATE (integer).
.TP 1i
attribute_val
Attribute value.

.SH OUTPUT PARAMETER
.ft R
.TP 1i
IERROR
Fortran only: Error status (integer). 

.SH DESCRIPTION
.ft R
Note that use of this routine is \fIdeprecated\fP as of MPI-2, and
was \fIdeleted\fP in MPI-3. Please use MPI_Comm_set_attr.  This
function does not have a C++ or mpi_f08 binding.
.sp
MPI_Attr_put stores the stipulated attribute value attribute_val for subsequent retrieval by MPI_Attr_get. If the value is already present, then the outcome is as if MPI_Attr_delete was first called to delete the previous value (and the callback function delete_fn was executed), and a new value was next stored. The call is erroneous if there is no key with value keyval; in particular MPI_KEYVAL_INVALID is an erroneous key value. The call will fail if the delete_fn function returned an error code other than MPI_SUCCESS.

.SH NOTES
.ft R
Values of the permanent attributes MPI_TAG_UB, MPI_HOST,
MPI_IO, and MPI_WTIME_IS_GLOBAL may not be changed.
.sp
The type of the attribute value depends on whether C or Fortran is being used. In C, an attribute value is a pointer (void *); in Fortran, it is a single integer (not a pointer, since Fortran has no pointers and there are systems for which a pointer does not fit in an integer, e.g., any  32-bit address system that uses 64 bits for Fortran DOUBLE PRECISION).
.sp
If an attribute is already present, the delete function (specified when the corresponding keyval was created) will be called.

.SH ERRORS
Almost all MPI routines return an error value; C routines as the value of the function and Fortran routines in the last argument. C++ functions do not return errors. If the default error handler is set to MPI::ERRORS_THROW_EXCEPTIONS, then on error the C++ exception mechanism will be used to throw an MPI::Exception object.
.sp
Before the error value is returned, the current MPI error handler is
called. By default, this error handler aborts the MPI job, except for I/O function errors. The error handler
may be changed with MPI_Comm_set_errhandler; the predefined error handler MPI_ERRORS_RETURN may be used to cause error values to be returned. Note that MPI does not guarantee that an MPI program can continue past an error.
