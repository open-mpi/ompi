[execv-error]

The singleton application was not able to find an executable in your
PATH or in the directory where PRTE was initially installed, and
therefore cannot continue.

For reference, we tried the following command:

  %s

and got the error %s.

This could mean that your PATH or executable name is wrong, or that
you do not have the necessary permissions.  Please ensure that the
executable is able to be found and executed as it is required for
singleton operations.
