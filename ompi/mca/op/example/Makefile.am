# This is an example op component.  This Makefile.am is a typical
# example of how to integrate into Open MPI's Automake-based build
# system.
#
# See https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi/wiki/devel-CreateComponent
# for more details on how to make Open MPI components.

# First, list all .h and .c sources.  It is necessary to list all .h
# files so that they will be picked up in the distribution tarball.

# Open MPI components can be compiled two ways:
#
# 1. As a standalone dynamic shared object (DSO), sometimes called a
# dynamically loadable library (DLL).
#
# 2. As a static library that is slurped up into the upper-level
# libmpi library (regardless of whether libmpi is a static or dynamic
# library).  This is called a "Libtool convenience library".
#
# The component needs to create an output library in this top-level
# component directory, and named either mca_<type>_<name>.la (for DSO
# builds) or libmca_<type>_<name>.la (for static builds).  The OMPI
# build system will have set the
# MCA_BUILD_ompi_<framework>_<component>_DSO AM_CONDITIONAL to indicate
# which way this component should be built.
