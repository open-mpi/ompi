 *
 * Function:  Allreduce using Rabenseifner's algorithm.
 * Accepts:   Same arguments as MPI_Allreduce
 * Returns:   MPI_SUCCESS or error code
 *
 * Description: an implementation of Rabenseifner's allreduce algorithm [1, 2].
 *   [1] Rajeev Thakur, Rolf Rabenseifner and William Gropp.
 *       Optimization of Collective Communication Operations in MPICH //
 *       The Int. Journal of High Performance Computing Applications. Vol 19,
 *       Issue 1, pp. 49--66.
 *   [2] http://www.hlrs.de/mpi/myreduce.html.
 * 
 * This algorithm is a combination of a reduce-scatter implemented with
 * recursive vector halving and recursive distance doubling, followed either
 * by an allgather implemented with recursive doubling [1].
 * 
 * Step 1. If the number of processes is not a power of two, reduce it to
 * the nearest lower power of two (p' = 2^{\floor{\log_2 p}})
 * by removing r = p - p' extra processes as follows. In the first 2r processes
 * (ranks 0 to 2r - 1), all the even ranks send the second half of the input
 * vector to their right neighbor (rank + 1), and all the odd ranks send
 * the first half of the input vector to their left neighbor (rank - 1).
 * The even ranks compute the reduction on the first half of the vector and
 * the odd ranks compute the reduction on the second half. The odd ranks then
 * send the result to their left neighbors (the even ranks). As a result,
 * the even ranks among the first 2r processes now contain the reduction with
 * the input vector on their right neighbors (the odd ranks). These odd ranks
 * do not participate in the rest of the algorithm, which leaves behind
 * a power-of-two number of processes. The first r even-ranked processes and
 * the last p - 2r processes are now renumbered from 0 to p' - 1.
 *
 * Step 2. The remaining processes now perform a reduce-scatter by using
 * recursive vector halving and recursive distance doubling. The even-ranked
 * processes send the second half of their buffer to rank + 1 and the odd-ranked
 * processes send the first half of their buffer to rank - 1. All processes
 * then compute the reduction between the local buffer and the received buffer.
 * In the next log_2(p') - 1 steps, the buffers are recursively halved, and the
 * distance is doubled. At the end, each of the p' processes has 1 / p' of the
 * total reduction result.
 *
 * Step 3. An allgather is performed by using recursive vector doubling and
 * distance halving. All exchanges are executed in reverse order relative
 * to recursive doubling on previous step. If the number of processes is not
 * a power of two, the total result vector must be sent to the r processes
 * that were removed in the first step.
 * 
 * Limitations:
 *   count >= 2^{\floor{\log_2 p}}
 *   commutative operations only
 *   intra-communicators only
 *
 * Memory requirements (per process):
 *   count * typesize + 4 * log_2(p) * sizeof(int) = O(count)
