[comm-select:none-available]
Although some coll components are available on your system, none of
them said that they could be used for a new communicator.

This is extremely unusual -- either the "basic", "libnbc" or "self" components
should be able to be chosen for any communicator.  As such, this
likely means that something else is wrong (although you should double
check that the "basic", "libnbc" and "self" coll components are available on
your system -- check the output of the "ompi_info" command).

[comm-select:no-function-available]
Although some coll components are available on your system, none of
them said that they could be used for %s on a new communicator.

This is extremely unusual -- either the "basic", "libnbc" or "self" components
should be able to be chosen for any communicator.  As such, this
likely means that something else is wrong (although you should double
check that the "basic", "libnbc" and "self" coll components are available on
your system -- check the output of the "ompi_info" command).
#[comm-unselect:failed-finalize]
A coll module failed to finalize properly when a communicator that was
using it was destroyed.

This is somewhat unusual: the module itself may be at fault, or this
may be a symptom of another issue (e.g., a memory problem).
