[comm-select:none-available]
Although some coll components are available on your system, none of
them said that they could be used for a new communicator.

This is extremely unusual -- in a worse case scenario, the "basic"
component should be able to be chosen for any communicator.  As such,
this likely means that something else is wrong (although you should
double check that the "basic" coll component is available on your
system -- look at the output of the "ompi_info" command).
#
[comm-unselect:failed-finalize]
A coll module failed to finalize properly when a communicator that was
using it was destroyed.  

This is somewhat unusual: the module itself may be at fault, or this
may be a symptom of another issue (e.g., a memory problem).
#
[comm-unselect:basic-failed-finalize]
The basic coll module failed to finalize properly when a communicator
that was using it was destroyed.  This happened on the communicator
named "%s".

This is extremely unusual and typically indicates some other kind of
problem (e.g., a memory problem)
