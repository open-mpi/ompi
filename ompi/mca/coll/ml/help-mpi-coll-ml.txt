[empty-sub-group]
ML topology configuration explicitly requested for this subgroup: 

    %s

Such configuration results in a creation of empty groups. As a result, ML
framework cannot configure requested collective operations. ML framework will be
disabled. One configuration that might enable ML component is --mca bcol_base_string basesmuma,ptpcoll 
--mca sbgp_base_subgroups_string basesmuma,p2p

[allreduce-not-supported]
This BCOL is configured in one of the hierarchy :

    %s

The BCOL does not support Allreduce for all
operations and datatype combination. In addition, you did not suggest 
alternate topology building configurations.

[allreduce-alt-nosupport]
The hierarchy is configured with alternate BCOL:

    %s

Both the original topology and alternate topology not support Allreduce for all
operations and datatype combination. In addition, you did not suggest 
alternate topology building configurations.

[fragmentation-disabled]

ML could not be used because the mca param coll_ml_enable_fragmentation
was set to zero and there is a bcol that does not support 
zero copy method.

[static-bcast-disabled]

ML could not be used because the mca param coll_ml_bcast_algorithm
was not set to static and other broadcast implementation was available.

[coll-ml-check-error]

ML detected an error on communicator %s

This communicator cannot be used any more

[coll-ml-check-fatal-error]

ML detected an unrecoverable error on intrinsic communicator %s

The program will now abort
