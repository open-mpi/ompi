[file fail-1]

The coll/libnbc module was unable to load rules contained in file %s.
The rule configuration format specified was %d.

The coll file parser was called with a null filename string.
This is an internal error. Parser should be used only if a rules filename was set by user.

This error leads to libnbc component to ignore the provided dynamic rules.
Internal logs can be enable using verbose MCA parameter OMPI_MCA_coll_base_verbose.
OMPI_MCA_coll_base_verbose = 1 (errors)
OMPI_MCA_coll_base_verbose >= 50 (file based rules selection print)
OMPI_MCA_coll_base_verbose >= 100 (file parsing logs print)
#
[file fail-2]

The coll/libnbc module was unable to load rules contained in file %s.
The rule configuration format specified was %d.

The coll file parser was called with a null rules pointer.
This is an internal error. Rules object pointer must be valid.

This error leads to libnbc component to ignore the provided dynamic rules.
Internal logs can be enable using verbose MCA parameter OMPI_MCA_coll_base_verbose.
OMPI_MCA_coll_base_verbose = 1 (errors)

#
[file fail-3]

The coll/libnbc module was unable to load rules contained in file %s.
The rule configuration format specified was %d.

The coll file parser was called with an invalid max collectives number.
This is an internal error. Max collectives number must be greater than 0.

This error leads to libnbc component to ignore the provided dynamic rules.
Internal logs can be enable using verbose MCA parameter OMPI_MCA_coll_base_verbose.
OMPI_MCA_coll_base_verbose = 1 (errors)
OMPI_MCA_coll_base_verbose >= 50 (file based rules selection print)
OMPI_MCA_coll_base_verbose >= 100 (file parsing logs print)
#
[file fail-4]

The coll/libnbc module was unable to load rules contained in file %s.
The rule configuration format specified was %d.

The file can't be opened. Either file is missing or access rights are wrong.
Check if the file path defined by the mca parameter
OMPI_MCA_coll_libnbc_dynamic_rules_filename is valid.

This error leads to libnbc component to ignore the provided dynamic rules.
Internal logs can be enable using verbose MCA parameter OMPI_MCA_coll_base_verbose.

#
[file fail-5]

The coll/libnbc module was unable to load rules contained in file %s.
The rule configuration format specified was %d.

The file format is unknown. It must be either
    0: Rules are defined according to a combination of
       collective_id, communicator size and message size
 or 1: Rules are defined according to a combination of
       collective_id, communicator nodes number, communicator size and message size.

This error leads to libnbc component to ignore the provided dynamic rules.
Internal logs can be enable using verbose MCA parameter OMPI_MCA_coll_base_verbose.

#
[file fail-6]

The coll/libnbc module was unable to load rules contained in file %s.
The rule configuration format specified was %d.

Rules object allocation failed. This can be induced by a memory resource exhaustion.

This error leads to libnbc component to ignore the provided dynamic rules.
Internal logs can be enable using verbose MCA parameter OMPI_MCA_coll_base_verbose.

#
[file fail-7]

The coll/libnbc module was unable to load rules contained in file %s.
The rule configuration format specified was %d.

The file parsing aborted. This can be induced by either:
    a format mismatch
 or a missing line
 or an invalid configuration number.

This error leads to libnbc component to ignore the provided dynamic rules.
Internal logs can be enable using verbose MCA parameter OMPI_MCA_coll_base_verbose.
