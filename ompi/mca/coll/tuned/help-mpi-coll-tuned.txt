[file fail]
The coll/tuned module was unable to load rules contained in file %s.
The rule configuration format specified was %d.
For further informations on occurred error,
you can enable debug output by setting verbosity level as follows:

export OMPI_MCA_coll_tuned_verbose=1

Error is potentially due to:

* File missing.
  Check if the file path defined by the mca parameter
  OMPI_MCA_coll_tuned_dynamic_rules_filename is valid.

* format mismatch.
  Verify the value of the mca parameter OMPI_MCA_coll_tuned_dynamic_rules_fileformat.
  0: Rules are defined according to a combination of
      collective_id, communicator size and message size.
      For example:

  1              # collective number
  9                # gather (1st level)
  2                # comm size config number
  1                  # Ranks number >= 1 (2nd level)
  1                  # msg size config number
  0 1 0 0              # Msgsize >= 0 (3rd level): basic linear
  8                  # Ranks number >= 8 (2nd level)
  3                  # msg size config number
  0 1 0 0              # Msgsize >= 0 (3rd level): basic linear
  8192 2 0 0           # Msgsize >= 8192 (3rd level): binomial
  4194304 3 0 1024     # Msgsize >= 4194304 (3rd level): linearsync (segsize of 1024 bytes)

This error leads to tuned component to ignore the provided dynamic rules.
Once error has been fixed you can check obtained rules using verbosity.
The following verbosity level threshold are defined:
OMPI_MCA_coll_tuned_verbose >= 10 (basic summary print)
OMPI_MCA_coll_tuned_verbose >= 50 (rules print)
OMPI_MCA_coll_tuned_verbose >= 100 (file parsing logs print)
