  abstract = {In this paper, we show that the performance of parallel file
  systems can vary greatly as a function of the selected data distributions,
  and that some data distributions can not be supported. Also, we describe how
  the parallel language extensions, though simplifying the programming, do not
  address the performance problems found in parallel file systems. \par We have
  devised an alternative scheme for conducting parallel I/O - the Two-Phase
  Access Strategy - which guarantees higher and more consistent performance
  over a wider spectrum of data distributions. We have designed and implemented
  runtime primitives that make use of the two-phase access strategy to conduct
  parallel I/O, and facilitate the programming of parallel I/O operations. We
  describe these primitives in detail and provide performance results which
  show that I/O access rates are improved by up to several orders of magnitude.
  Further, we show that the variation in performance over various data
  distributions is restricted to within a factor of 2 of the best access
  rate.},
  comment = {Much of this is the same as delrosario:two-phase, except for
  section~4 where they describe their actual run-time library of primitives,
  with a little bit about how it works. It's not clear, for example, how their
  meta-data structures are distributed across the machine. They also do not
  describe their methods for the data redistribution.}
