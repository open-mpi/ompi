/*
 * This program tests to see if fcntl returns success when asked to 
 * establish a file lock.  This test is intended for use on file systems
 * such as NFS that may not implement file locks.  ROMIO makes use
 * of file locks to implement certain operations, and may not work
 * properly if file locks are not available.  
 *
 * This is a simple test and has at least two limitations:
 * 
 * 1. Some implementations of NFS are known to return success for 
 * setting a file lock when in fact no lock has been set.  This
 * test will not detect such erroneous implementations of NFS
 *
 * 2. Some implementations will hang (enter and wait indefinitately)
 * within the fcntl call.  This program will also hang in that case.
 * Under normal conditions, this program should only take a few seconds to 
 * run.
 *
 * The program prints a message showing the success or failure of
 * setting the file lock and sets the return status to 0 on success and
 * non-zero on failure.  If there is a failure, the system routine
 * perror is also called to explain the reason.
