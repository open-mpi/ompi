     * if it ever might want to run during this MPI process.  It creates

     * that are available for selection when file handles are created.

     * and is only mentioned here for completeness.

     * file handle (or NULL).

     * Note that the types of the parameters have "struct" in them
     * (e.g., ompi_file_t" vs. a plain "ompi_file_t") to
     * avoid an include file loop.  All similar types (e.g., "struct
     * ompi_file_t *", "ompi_file_t *", and "MPI_File")
     * are all typedef'ed to be the same, so the fact that we use struct
     * here in the prototype is ok.
     *
     * This function is invoked when a new file handle is created and a
     * io component needs to be selected for it.  It should be invoked
     * near the end of the file handle creation process such that
     * almost everything else is functional on the file handle.
     *
     * This function invokes the selection process for io components,
     * which works as follows:
     *
     * - If the \em preferred argument is NULL, the selection set is
     *   defined to be all the components found during
     *   mca_io_base_find_available().
     * - If \em preferred is not NULL, then the selection set is just
     *   that component.  (However, in this mode, we may make 2 passes
     *   through the selection process -- more on this below).
     * - All components in the selection set are queried to see if they
     *   want to run with that file handle.  All components that want to
     *   run are ranked by their priority and the highest priority
     *   component is selected.  All non-selected components have their
     *   "unquery" function invoked to let them know that they were not
     *   selected.
     * - The selected module will have its "init" function
     *   invoked to let it know that it was selected.  All unselected
     *   components will have their file_unselect function invoked.
     * - If we fall through this entire process and no component is
     *   selected \em and the \em preferred argument is not NULL, then
     *   run the entire process again as if the \em preferred argument
     *   was NULL (i.e., use the entire available set of components).
     *
     * At the end of this process, we'll either have a single
     * component/module pair that is selected and initialized for the
     * file handle, or no component was selected and an error is
     * returned up the stack.
