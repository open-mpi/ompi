Please note that this is *NOT* a vanilla MPICH v3.2a2-84-gef1cf14
distribution of the ROMIO package from Argonne National Labs.
Various customizations had to be applied to the configuration process.
More to the point -- if replace this copy of ROMIO with a newer version,
it will likely not work.  :-(
