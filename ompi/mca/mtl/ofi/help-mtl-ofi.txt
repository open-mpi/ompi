[Not enough bits for CID]
OFI provider "%s" does not have enough free bits in its tag to fit the MPI
Communicator ID. See the mem_tag_format of the provider by running:
fi_info -v -p %s

  Local host: %s
  Location: %s:%d

[SEP unavailable]
Scalable Endpoint feature is required for Thread Grouping feature to work
but it is not supported by %s provider. Try disabling this feature.

  Location: %s:%d

[SEP ctxt limit]
Reached limit (%d) for number of OFI contexts that can be opened with the
provider. Creating new communicators beyond this limit is possible but
they will re-use existing contexts in round-robin fashion.
Using new communicators beyond the limit will impact performance.
