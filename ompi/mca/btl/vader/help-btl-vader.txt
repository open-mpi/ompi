[sys call fail]
A system call failed during vader shared memory BTL initialization
that should not have.  It is likely that your MPI job will now either
abort or experience performance degradation.

  System call: %s
  Error:       %s (errno %d)
#
[no locality]
WARNING: Missing locality information required for vader shared memory
BTL initialization. Continuing without shared memory support.
#
[knem permission denied]
WARING: Open MPI failed to open the /dev/knem device due to a
permissions problem.  Please check with your system administrator to
get the permissions fixed, or set the btl_vader_single_copy_mechanism
MCA variable to none to silence this warning and run without knem
support.

  Local host:            %s
  /dev/knem permissions: 0%o
#
[knem fail open]
WARNING: Open MPI failed to open the /dev/knem device due to a local
error. Please check with your system administrator to get the problem
fixed, or set the btl_vader_single_copy_mechanism MCA variable to none
to silence this warning and run without knem support.

The vader shared memory BTL will fall back on another single-copy
mechanism if one is available. This may result in lower performance.

  Local host: %s
  Errno:      %d (%s)
#
[knem get ABI fail]
WARNING: Open MPI failed to retrieve the ABI version from the
/dev/knem device due to a local error.  This usually indicates an
error in your knem installation; please check with your system
administrator, or set the btl_vader_single_copy_mechanism MCA variable
to none to silence this warning and run without knem support.

The vader shared memory BTL will fall back on another single-copy
mechanism if one is available. This may result in lower performance.

  Local host: %s
  Errno:      %d (%s)
#
[knem ABI mismatch]
WARNING: Open MPI was compiled with support for one version of the
knem kernel module, but it discovered a different version running in
/dev/knem. Open MPI needs to be installed with support for the same
version of knem as is in the running Linux kernel. Please check with
your system administrator, or set the btl_vader_single_copy_mechanism
MCA variable to none to silence this warning and run without knem
support.

The vader shared memory BTL will fall back on another single-copy
mechanism if one is available. This may result in lower performance.

  Local host:              %s
  Open MPI's knem version: 0x%x
  /dev/knem's version:     0x%x
#
[knem mmap fail]
Open MPI failed to map support from the knem Linux kernel module; this
shouldn't happen. Please check with your system administrator, or set
the btl_vader_single_copy_mechanism MCA variable to none to silence
this warning and run without knem support.

The vader shared memory BTL will fall back on another single-copy
mechanism if one is available. This may result in lower performance.

  Local host:  %s
  System call: mmap()
  Errno:       %d (%s)
#
[knem init error]
Open MPI encountered an error during the knem initialization. Please
check with your system administrator, or set the
btl_vader_single_copy_mechanism MCA variable to none to silence this
warning and run without knem support.

The vader shared memory BTL will fall back on another single-copy
mechanism if one is available. This may result in lower performance.

  Local host:  %s
  System call: %s
  Errno:       %d (%s)
#
[knem requested but not available]
WARNING: Linux kernel knem support was requested via the
btl_vader_single_copy_mechanism MCA parameter, but Knem support was either not
compiled into this Open MPI installation, or Knem support was unable
to be activated in this process.

The vader BTL will fall back on another single-copy mechanism if one
is available. This may result in lower performance.

  Local host: %s
#
[cma-permission-denied]
WARNING: Linux kernel CMA support was requested via the
btl_vader_single_copy_mechanism MCA variable, but CMA support is
not available due to restrictive ptrace settings.

The vader shared memory BTL will fall back on another single-copy
mechanism if one is available. This may result in lower performance.

  Local host: %s
#
[xpmem-make-failed]
WARNING: Could not generate an xpmem segment id for this process'
address space.

The vader shared memory BTL will fall back on another single-copy
mechanism if one is available. This may result in lower performance.

  Local host: %s
  Error code: %d (%s)
