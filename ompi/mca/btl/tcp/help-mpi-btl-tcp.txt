[invalid if_inexclude]
WARNING: An invalid value was given for btl_tcp_if_%s.  This
value will be ignored.

  Local host: %s
  Value:      %s
  Message:    %s

[invalid minimum port]
WARNING: An invalid value was given for the btl_tcp_port_min_%s. Legal
values are in the range [1 .. 2^16-1]. This value will be ignored
(reset to the default value of 1024).

[client connect fail]
WARNING: Open MPI failed to TCP connect to a peer MPI process.  This
should not happen.

Your Open MPI job may now fail.

  Message:    %s
  Error:      %s (%d)
#
[client handshake fail]
WARNING: Open MPI failed to handshake with a connecting peer MPI
process over TCP.  This should not happen.

Your Open MPI job may now fail.

  Local host: %s
  PID:        %d
  Message:    %s
#
[accept failed]
WARNING: The accept(3) system call failed on a TCP socket.  While this
should generally never happen on a well-configured HPC system, the
most common causes when it does occur are:

  * The process ran out of file descriptors
  * The operating system ran out of file descriptors
  * The operating system ran out of memory

Your Open MPI job will likely hang until the failure resason is fixed
(e.g., more file descriptors and/or memory becomes available), and may
eventually timeout / abort.

  Errno:      %d (%s)
