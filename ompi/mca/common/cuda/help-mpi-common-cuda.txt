[cuCtxGetCurrent failed not initialized]
WARNING: The call to cuCtxGetCurrent() failed while attempting to register
internal memory with the CUDA environment.  The program will continue to run,
but the performance of GPU memory transfers may be reduced.  This failure
indicates that the CUDA environment is not yet initialized.  To eliminate
this warning, ensure that CUDA is initialized prior to calling MPI_Init.

NOTE: You can turn off this warning by setting the MCA parameter
      mpi_common_cuda_warning to 0.

[dlopen disabled] 
Open MPI was compiled without dynamic library support (e.g., with the
 --disable-dlopen flag), and therefore cannot utilize CUDA support.  

If you need CUDA support, reconfigure Open MPI with dynamic library support enabled.
#
[unknown ltdl error]
While attempting to load the supporting libcuda.so library, an error
occurred.  This really should rarely happen.  Please notify the Open
MPI developers. 
   Function:     %s
   Return Value: %d
   Error string: %s
#
[dlopen failed]
The library attempted to open the following supporting CUDA libraries, 
but each of them failed.  CUDA-aware support is disabled.
%s
If you are not interested in CUDA-aware support, then run with 
--mca mpi_cuda_support 0 to suppress this message.  If you are interested
in CUDA-aware support, then try setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the location
of libcuda.so.1 to get passed this issue.
#
[dlsym failed]
An error occurred while trying to map in the address of a function.
  Function Name: %s
  Error string:  %s
CUDA-aware support is disabled.
#
[bufferID failed]
An error occurred while trying to get the BUFFER_ID of a GPU memory
region.  This could cause incorrect results.  Turn of GPU Direct RDMA
support by running with --mca btl_openib_cuda_want_gdr_support 0.
