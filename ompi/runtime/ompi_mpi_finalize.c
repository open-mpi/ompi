       *all* connected processes.  This only means that all processes
       have to call it.  It does *not* mean that all connected
       processes need to synchronize (either directly or indirectly).

       For example, it is quite easy to construct complicated
       scenarios where one job is "connected" to another job via
       transitivity, but have no direct knowledge of each other.
       Consider the following case: job A spawns job B, and job B
       later spawns job C.  A "connectedness" graph looks something
       like this:

           A <--> B <--> C

       So what are we *supposed* to do in this case?  If job A is
       still connected to B when it calls FINALIZE, should it block
       until jobs B and C also call FINALIZE?

       After lengthy discussions many times over the course of this
       project, the issue was finally decided at the Louisville Feb
       2009 meeting: no.

       Rationale:

       - "Collective" does not mean synchronizing.  It only means that
         every process call it.  Hence, in this scenario, every
         process in A, B, and C must call FINALIZE.

       - KEY POINT: if A calls FINALIZE, then it is erroneous for B or
         C to try to communicate with A again.

       - Hence, OMPI is *correct* to only effect a barrier across each
         jobs' MPI_COMM_WORLD before exiting.  Specifically, if A
         calls FINALIZE long before B or C, it's *correct* if A exits
         at any time (and doesn't notify B or C that it is exiting).

       - Arguably, if B or C do try to communicate with the now-gone
         A, OMPI should try to print a nice error ("you tried to
         communicate with a job that is already gone...") instead of
         segv or other Badness.  However, that is an *extremely*
         difficult problem -- sure, it's easy for A to tell B that it
         is finalizing, but how can A tell C?  A doesn't even know
         about C.  You'd need to construct a "connected" graph in a
         distributed fashion, which is fraught with race conditions,
         etc.

      Hence, our conclusion is: OMPI is *correct* in its current
      behavior (of only doing a barrier across its own COMM_WORLD)
      before exiting.  Any problems that occur are as a result of
      erroneous MPI applications.  We *could* tighten up the erroneous
      cases and ensure that we print nice error messages / don't
      crash, but that is such a difficult problem that we decided we
      have many other, much higher priority issues to handle that deal
      with non-erroneous cases. */

    /* Wait for everyone to reach this point.  This is a PMIx
       barrier instead of an MPI barrier for (at least) two reasons:

       1. An MPI barrier doesn't ensure that all messages have been
          transmitted before exiting (e.g., a BTL can lie and buffer a
          message without actually injecting it to the network, and
          therefore require further calls to that BTL's progress), so
          the possibility of a stranded message exists.

       2. If the MPI communication is using an unreliable transport,
          there's a problem of knowing that everyone has *left* the
          barrier.  E.g., one proc can send its ACK to the barrier
          message to a peer and then leave the barrier, but the ACK
          can get lost and therefore the peer is left in the barrier.

       Point #1 has been known for a long time; point #2 emerged after
       we added the first unreliable BTL to Open MPI and fixed the
       del_procs behavior around May of 2014 (see
       https://svn.open-mpi.org/trac/ompi/ticket/4669#comment:4 for
