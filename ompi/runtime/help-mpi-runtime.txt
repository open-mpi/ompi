[mpi_init:startup:internal-failure]
It looks like %s failed for some reason; your parallel process is
likely to abort.  There are many reasons that a parallel process can
fail during %s; some of which are due to configuration or environment
problems.  This failure appears to be an internal failure; here's some
additional information (which may only be relevant to an Open MPI
developer):

  %s
  --> Returned "%s" (%d) instead of "Success" (0)
#
[mpi_init:startup:pml-add-procs-fail]
MPI_INIT has failed because at least one MPI process is unreachable
from another.  This *usually* means that an underlying communication
plugin -- such as a BTL or an MTL -- has either not loaded or not
allowed itself to be used.  Your MPI job will now abort.

You may wish to try to narrow down the problem;

 * Check the output of ompi_info to see which BTL/MTL plugins are
   available.
 * Run your application with MPI_THREAD_SINGLE.
 * Set the MCA parameter btl_base_verbose to 100 (or mtl_base_verbose,
   if using MTL-based communications) to see exactly which
   communication plugins were considered and/or discarded.
#
[mpi-param-check-enabled-but-compiled-out]
WARNING: The MCA parameter mpi_param_check has been set to true, but
parameter checking has been compiled out of Open MPI.  The
mpi_param_check value has therefore been ignored.
#
[mpi_init: invoked multiple times]
Open MPI has detected that this process has attempted to initialize
MPI (via MPI_INIT or MPI_INIT_THREAD) more than once.  This is
erroneous.
#
[mpi_init: already finalized]
Open MPI has detected that this process has attempted to initialize
MPI (via MPI_INIT or MPI_INIT_THREAD) after MPI_FINALIZE has been
called.  This is erroneous.
#
[mpi_finalize: not initialized]
The function MPI_FINALIZE was invoked before MPI was initialized in a
process on host %s, PID %d.

This indicates an erroneous MPI program; MPI must be initialized
before it can be finalized.
#
[mpi_finalize:invoked_multiple_times]
The function MPI_FINALIZE was invoked multiple times in a single
process on host %s, PID %d.

This indicates an erroneous MPI program; MPI_FINALIZE is only allowed
to be invoked exactly once in a process.
#
[sparse groups enabled but compiled out]
WARNING: The MCA parameter mpi_use_sparse_group_storage has been set
to true, but sparse group support was not compiled into Open MPI.  The
mpi_use_sparse_group_storage value has therefore been ignored.
#
[heterogeneous-support-unavailable]
This installation of Open MPI was configured without support for
heterogeneous architectures, but at least one node in the allocation
was detected to have a different architecture. The detected node was:

Node: %s

In order to operate in a heterogeneous environment, please reconfigure
Open MPI with --enable-heterogeneous.
#
[no cuda support]
The user requested CUDA support with the --mca mpi_cuda_support 1 flag
but the library was not compiled with any support.
#
[noconxcpt]
The user has called an operation involving MPI_Connect and/or MPI_Accept,
but this environment lacks the necessary infrastructure support for
that operation. Open MPI relies on the PMIx_Publish/Lookup (or one of
its predecessors) APIs for this operation.

This typically happens when launching outside of mpirun where the underlying
resource manager does not provide publish/lookup support. One way of solving
the problem is to simply use mpirun to start the application.
#
[lib-call-fail]
A library call unexpectedly failed.  This is a terminal error; please
show this message to an Open MPI wizard:

        Library call: %s
         Source file: %s
  Source line number: %d

Aborting...
#
[spc: MPI_T disabled]
There was an error registering software performance counters (SPCs) as
MPI_T performance variables.  Your job will continue, but SPCs will be
disabled for MPI_T.
