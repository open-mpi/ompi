# Note that the ordering of "." in SUBDIRS is important: the C++,
# Fortran mpif.h, and use mpi/use mpi_f08 bindings are all in
# standalone .la files that depend on libmpi.la.  So we must fully
# build libmpi.la first.

# NOTE: A handful of files in mpi/fortran/base must be included in
# libmpi.la.  But we wanted to keep all the Fortran sources together
# in the same tree, so we moved those sources to a separate
# subdirectory with its own Makefile.include that is included in this
# Makefile.am (NOTE: it did *not* work to put all the files -- base
# and non-base -- into mpi/fortran/mpif-h and have both a regular
# Makefile.am for building the mpif.h bindings library and a separate
# Makefile.include that was included in this top-level Makefile.am;
# problems occurred with "make distclean" and files in the
# ompi/mpi/fortran/mpif-h/.deps directory -- it's not clear whether
# this is an AM bug or whether this behavior is simply not supported).
# This ompi/mpi/fortran/base/Makefile.include file makes a convenience
# LT library that is then sucked into libmpi.la (the
# ompi/mpi/fortran/base sources must be compiled with special
# CPPFLAGS; we can't just add the raw sources to libmpi_la_SOURCES,
# unfortunately).

# The end of the result is that libmpi.la -- including a few sources
# from mpi/fortran/base -- is fully built before the C++, mpif.h, and
# use mpi/use mpi_f08 bindings are built.  Therefore, the C++, mpif.h
# and use mpi/use mpi_f08 bindings libraries can all link against
# libmpi.la.

# NOTE: The ordering of this list is VERY CAREFULLY CRAFTED!  Do not
# change the ordering unless you really know what you're doing.  :-)
