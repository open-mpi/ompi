! Do ***not*** copy this file to the directory where your Fortran
! fortran application is compiled unless it is absolutely necessary!  Most
! modern Fortran compilers now support the -I command line flag, which
! tells the compiler where to find .h files (specifically, this one).  For
! example:
!
!      shell$ mpifort foo.f -o foo -I$OMPI_HOME/include
!
! will probably do the trick (assuming that you have set OMPI_HOME
! properly).
!
! That being said, OMPI's "mpifort" wrapper compiler should
! automatically include the -I option for you.  The following command
! should be equivalent to the command listed above:
!
!      shell$ mpifort foo.f -o foo
!
! You should not copy this file to your local directory because it is
! possible that this file will be changed between versions of Open MPI.
! Indeed, this mpif.h is incompatible with the mpif.f of other
! implementations of MPI.  Using this mpif.h with other implementations
! of MPI, or with other versions of Open MPI will result in undefined
! behavior (to include incorrect results, segmentation faults,
! unexplainable "hanging" in your application, etc.).  Always use the
! -I command line option instead (or let mpifort do it for you).
