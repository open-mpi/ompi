# This Makefile is not traversed during a normal "make all" in an OMPI
# build.  It *is* traversed during "make dist", however.  So you can
# put EXTRA_DIST targets in here.
#
# You can also use this as a convenience for building this MPI
# extension (i.e., "make all" in this directory to invoke "make all"
# in all the subdirectories).
