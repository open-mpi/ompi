[MPI function not supported]
Your application has invoked an MPI function that is not supported in
this environment.

  MPI function: %s
  Reason:       %s
[info-set-with-reserved-prefix]
Comments
MPI_Info_set warning, key is using a reserved prefix.
  Key:             %s
  Reserved prefix: %s
[mismatched-split_type-values]
Detected mismatched split_type and/or info "mpi_hw_resource_type" values
in a call to MPI_Comm_split_type between peers in the communicator.
  split_type:  %s (%d)
  info:        %s
[unexpected-split-type]
Detected an unexpected split type in a call to MPI_Comm_split_type.
  split_type:  %s (%d)
[disjointness-set-again]
Communicator disjointness should only be set once at initialization.
Attempts to modify the state are illegal and shall be ignored.
[cid-base-not-set]
An internal error has occurred when creating a new communicator.  This
should probably never happen:

* cid_base is not set.  Either nresults
  is zero or no returned info matches PMIX_GROUP_CONTEXT_ID.

Please contact the Open MPI developer community with this message and
a small example code that reproduces the issue.
