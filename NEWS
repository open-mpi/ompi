===========================================================================

This file contains the main features as well as overviews of specific
bug fixes (and other actions) for each version of Open MPI since
version 1.0.

As more fully described in the "Software Version Number" section in
the README file, Open MPI typically releases two separate version
series simultaneously.  Since these series have different goals and
are semi-independent of each other, a single NEWS-worthy item may be
introduced into different series at different times.  For example,
feature F was introduced in the vA.B series at version vA.B.C, and was
later introduced into the vX.Y series at vX.Y.Z.

The first time feature F is released, the item will be listed in the
vA.B.C section, denoted as:

   (** also to appear: X.Y.Z) -- indicating that this item is also
                                 likely to be included in future release
                                 version vX.Y.Z.

When vX.Y.Z is later released, the same NEWS-worthy item will also be
included in the vX.Y.Z section and be denoted as:

   (** also appeared: A.B.C)  -- indicating that this item was previously
                                 included in release version vA.B.C.

Trunk (not on release branches yet)
-----------------------------------
- CUDA-aware support can now handle GPUs within a node that do not
  support CUDA IPC.  Earlier versions would get error and abort.
- Do not build the MPI C++ bindings by default.  They must be enabled
  via --enable-mpi-cxx.

  method that only exchanges endpoint data on a per-peer basis
  on first message. Not all transports have been updated to use
  this feature. Set the rte_orte_direct_modex parameter to "1"
  to enable this mode.


1.7.4
-----
 **********************************************************************
 *      CRITICAL CHANGE
 *
 * As of release 1.7.4, OpenMPI's default mapping, ranking, and binding
 * settings have changed:
 *
 * Mapping:
 *   if #procs <= 2, default to map-by core
 *   if #procs > 2, default to map-by socket
 * Ranking:
 *   if default mapping is used, then default to rank-by slot
 *   if map-by <obj> is given, then default to rank-by <obj>,
 *      where <obj> is whatever object we mapped against
 * Binding:
 *   default to bind-to core
 *
 * Users can override any of these settings individually using the
 * corresponding MCA parameter. Note that multi-threaded applications
 * in particular may want to override at least the binding default
 * to allow threads to use multiple cores.

  - Added btl_openib_if_[in|ex]clude MCA parameters for
    including/excluding comma-delimited lists of HCAs and ports.
  - Added RDMA CM support, includng btl_openib_cpc_[in|ex]clude MCA
    parameters
  - Added NUMA support to only use "near" network adapters
  - Added "Bucket SRQ" (BSRQ) support to better utilize registered
    memory, including btl_openib_receive_queues MCA parameter
  - Added ConnectX XRC support (and integrated with BSRQ)
  - Added btl_openib_ib_max_inline_data MCA parameter
  - Added iWARP support
  - Revamped flow control mechansisms to be more efficient
  - "mpi_leave_pinned=1" is now the default when possible,
    automatically improving performance for large messages when
    application buffers are re-used
- Elimiated duplicated error messages when multiple MPI processes fail
  with the same error.
- Added NUMA support to the shared memory BTL.
- Add Valgrind-based memory checking for MPI-semantic checks.
- Add support for some optional Fortran datatypes (MPI_LOGICAL1,
  MPI_LOGICAL2, MPI_LOGICAL4 and MPI_LOGICAL8).
- Remove the use of the STL from the C++ bindings.
- Added support for Platform/LSF job launchers.  Must be Platform LSF
  v7.0.2 or later.
- Updated ROMIO with the version from MPICH2 1.0.7.
- Added RDMA capable one-sided component (called rdma), which
  can be used with BTL components that expose a full one-sided
  interface.
- Added the optional datatype MPI_REAL2. As this is added to the "end of"
  predefined datatypes in the fortran header files, there will not be
  any compatibility issues.
- Added Portable Linux Processor Affinity (PLPA) for Linux.
- Addition of a finer symbols export control via the visibiliy feature
  offered by some compilers.
- Added checkpoint/restart process fault tolerance support. Initially
  support a LAM/MPI-like protocol.
- Removed "mvapi" BTL; all InfiniBand support now uses the OpenFabrics
  driver stacks ("openib" BTL).
- Added more stringent MPI API parameter checking to help user-level
  debugging.
- The ptmalloc2 memory manager component is now by default built as
  a standalone library named libopenmpi-malloc.  Users wanting to
  use leave_pinned with ptmalloc2 will now need to link the library
  into their application explicitly.  All other users will use the
  libc-provided allocator instead of Open MPI's ptmalloc2.  This change
  may be overriden with the configure option enable-ptmalloc2-internal
- The leave_pinned options will now default to using mallopt on
  Linux in the cases where ptmalloc2 was not linked in.  mallopt
  will also only be available if munmap can be intercepted (the
  default whenever Open MPI is not compiled with --without-memory-
  manager.
- Open MPI will now complain and refuse to use leave_pinned if
  no memory intercept / mallopt option is available.
- Add option of using Perl-based wrapper compilers instead of the
  C-based wrapper compilers.  The Perl-based version does not
  have the features of the C-based version, but does work better
  in cross-compile environments.

  tokens.  Thanks to Orion Poplawski for identifying the problem and
  to Ralf Wildenhues for suggesting the fix.

- Fix the BProc allocator to not potentially use the same resources
  across multiple ORTE universes.
- Fix gm resource leak.
- More latency reduction throughout the code base.
- Make the TM PLS (PBS Pro, Torque, Open PBS) more scalable, and fix
  some latent bugs that crept in v1.1.  Thanks to the Thunderbird crew
  at Sandia National Laboratories and Martin Schaffoner for access to
  testing facilities to make this happen.
- Added new command line options to mpirun:
  --nolocal: Do not run any MPI processes on the same node as mpirun
    (compatibility with the OSC mpiexec launcher)
  --nooversubscribe: Abort if the number of processes requested would
    cause oversubscription
  --quiet / -q: do not show spurious status messages
  --version / -V: show the version of Open MPI
- Fix bus error in XGrid process starter.  Thanks to Frank from the
  Open MPI user's list for identifying the problem.
- Fix data size mismatches that caused memory errors on PPC64
  platforms during the startup of the openib BTL.
- Allow propagation of SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 signals from mpirun to
  back-end MPI processes.
- Add missing MPI::Is_finalized() function.


1.1
---

- Various MPI datatype fixes, optimizations.
- Fixed various problems on the SPARC architecture (e.g., not
  correctly aligning addresses within structs).
- Improvements in various run-time error messages to be more clear
  about what they mean and where the errors are occurring.
- Various fixes to mpirun's handling of --prefix.
- Updates and fixes for Cray/Red Storm support.
- Major improvements to the Fortran 90 MPI bindings:
  - General improvements in compile/linking time and portability
    between different F90 compilers.
  - Addition of "trivial", "small" (the default), and "medium"
    Fortran 90 MPI module sizes (v1.0.x's F90 module was
    equivalent to "medium").  See the README file for more
    explanation.
  - Fix various MPI F90 interface functions and constant types to
    match.  Thanks to Michael Kluskens for pointing out the problems
    to us.
- Allow short messagees to use RDMA (vs. send/receive semantics) to a
  limited number peers in both the mvapi and openib BTL components.
  This reduces communication latency over IB channels.
- Numerous performance improvements throughout the entire code base.
- Many minor threading fixes.
- Add a define OMPI_SKIP_CXX to allow the user to skip the mpicxx.h from
  being included in mpi.h. It allows the user to compile C code with a CXX
  compiler without including the CXX bindings.
- PERUSE support has been added. In order to activate it add
  --enable-peruse to the configure options. All events described in
  the PERUSE 2.0 draft are supported, plus one Open MPI
  extension. PERUSE_COMM_REQ_XFER_CONTINUE allow to see how the data
  is segmented internally, using multiple interfaces or the pipeline
  engine. However, this version only support one event of each type
  simultaneously attached to a communicator.
- Add support for running jobs in heterogeneous environments.
  Currently supports environments with different endianness and
  different representations of C++ bool and Fortran LOGICAL.
  Mismatched sizes for other datatypes is not supported.
- Open MPI now includes an implementation of the MPI-2 One-Sided
  Communications specification.
- Open MPI is now configurable in cross-compilation environments.
  Several Fortran 77 and Fortran 90 tests need to be pre-seeded with
  results from a config.cache-like file.
- Add --debug option to mpirun to generically invoke a parallel debugger.

  on multi-NIC nodes, a NIC could get paired with a NIC on another
  network (typically resulting in deadlock).  Thanks to Ken Mighell
  for pointing this out to us.
- Change the behavior of orterun (mpirun, mpirexec) to search for
  argv[0] and the cwd on the target node (i.e., the node where the
  executable will be running in all systems except BProc, where the
  searches are run on the node where orterun is invoked).

  unpacking data. Now we can position the convertor to any position
  not only on the predefined types boundaries. Thanks to Yvan Fournier
  for reporting this to us.
