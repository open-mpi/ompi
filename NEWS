This file contains the main features as well as overviews of specific
bug fixes (and other actions) for each version of Open MPI since
version 1.0.

1.2.3
-----

- Fix a regression in comm_spawn functionality that inadvertently
  caused the mapping of child processes to always start at the same
  place.  Thanks to Prakash Velayutham for helping discover the
  problem.

  node.  Thanks to Guillaume Thomas-Collignon for bringing the issue
  to our attention.
- Fix MPI_IPROBE to properly handle MPI_STATUS_IGNORE on mx and psm
  MTLs. Thanks to Sophia Corwell for finding this and supplying a
  reproducer.
- Fix some error messages in the tcp BTL.
- Use _NSGetEnviron instead of environ on Mac OS X so that there
  are no undefined symbols in the shared libraries.

  params.  The old names are depreciated, but will still work.
- Add -wd as a synonymn for the -wdir orterun/mpirun option.
- Fix the mvapi BTL to compile properly with compilers that do not support

  space the header was occupying.
- Add support for MPI_2COMPLEX and MPI_2DOUBLE_COMPLEX.
- Always ensure to create $(includedir)/openmpi, even if the C++
  bindings are disabled so that the wrapper compilers don't point to
  a directory that doesn't exist.  Thanks to Martin Audet for
  identifying the problem.
- Fixes for endian handling in MPI process startup.
- Openib BTL initialization fixes for cases where MPI processes in the

  wrapper compilers).
- Many bug fixes to MPI-2 one-sided support.
- Added support for TotalView message queue debugging.
- Fixes for MPI_STATUS_SET_ELEMENTS.

  there is only one node available.
- Added man pages for several Open MPI executables and the MPI API

- A number of fixes for Alpha platforms.
- A variety of Fortran API fixes.
- Build the Fortran MPI API as a separate library to allow these
  functions to be profiled properly.
- Add new --enable-mpirun-prefix-by-default configure option to always
  imply the --prefix option to mpirun, preventing many rsh/ssh-based
  users from needing to modify their shell startup files.
- Add a number of missing constants in the C++ bindings.
- Added tight integration with Sun N1 Grid Engine (N1GE) 6 and the
  open source Grid Engine.
- Allow building the F90 MPI bindings as shared libraries for most

  (not a C compiler that "sorta works" as a C++ compiler).

  for 127.0.0.0/8, rather than just 127.0.0.1.


1.1.5
-----

- Implement MPI_TYPE_CREATE_DARRAY function.
- Fix race condition in shared memory BTL startup that could cause MPI
  applications to hang in MPI_INIT.
- Fix syntax error in a corner case of the event library.  Thanks to
  Bert Wesarg for pointing this out.
- Add new MCA parameter (mpi_preconnect_oob) for pre-connecting the
  "out of band" channels between all MPI processes.  Most helpful for
  MPI applications over InfiniBand where process A sends an initial
  message to process B, but process B does not enter the MPI library
  for a long time.

  all processes upon termination of an MPI job.

  tokens.  Thanks to Orion Poplawski for identifying the problem and
  to Ralf Wildenhues for suggesting the fix.

- If using the Intel 9.0 v20051201 compiler on an IA64 platform, the
  ptmalloc2 memory manager component will automatically disable
  itself.  Other versions of the Intel compiler on this platform seem
  to work fine (e.g., 9.1).
- Added "host" MPI_Info key to MPI_COMM_SPAWN and
  MPI_COMM_SPAWN_MULTIPLE.
- Add missing C++ methods: MPI::Datatype::Create_indexed_block,
  MPI::Datatype::Create_resized, MPI::Datatype::Get_true_extent.

  (according to Open MPI) are not already in use.

  will run on all currently-allocated resources (e.g., within a batch
  job such as SLURM, Torque, etc.).

- Fix the BProc allocator to not potentially use the same resources
  across multiple ORTE universes.
- Fix gm resource leak.

  some latent bugs that crept in v1.1.  Thanks to the Thunderbird crew
  at Sandia National Laboratories and Martin Schaffoner for access to
  testing facilities to make this happen.
- Added new command line options to mpirun:
  --nolocal: Do not run any MPI processes on the same node as mpirun
    (compatibility with the OSC mpiexec launcher)
  --nooversubscribe: Abort if the number of processes requested would
    cause oversubscription
  --quiet / -q: do not show spurious status messages
  --version / -V: show the version of Open MPI
- Fix bus error in XGrid process starter.  Thanks to Frank from the
  Open MPI user's list for identifying the problem.

  platforms during the startup of the openib BTL.
- Allow propagation of SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 signals from mpirun to
  back-end MPI processes.
- Add missing MPI::Is_finalized() function.


1.1
---

- Various MPI datatype fixes, optimizations.
- Fixed various problems on the SPARC architecture (e.g., not
  correctly aligning addresses within structs).
- Improvements in various run-time error messages to be more clear
  about what they mean and where the errors are occurring.
- Various fixes to mpirun's handling of --prefix.
- Updates and fixes for Cray/Red Storm support.
- Major improvements to the Fortran 90 MPI bindings:
  - General improvements in compile/linking time and portability
    between different F90 compilers.
  - Addition of "trivial", "small" (the default), and "medium"
    Fortran 90 MPI module sizes (v1.0.x's F90 module was
    equivalent to "medium").  See the README file for more
    explanation.
  - Fix various MPI F90 interface functions and constant types to
    match.  Thanks to Michael Kluskens for pointing out the problems
    to us.
- Allow short messagees to use RDMA (vs. send/receive semantics) to a
  limited number peers in both the mvapi and openib BTL components.
  This reduces communication latency over IB channels.
- Numerous performance improvements throughout the entire code base.
- Many minor threading fixes.
- Add a define OMPI_SKIP_CXX to allow the user to skip the mpicxx.h from
  being included in mpi.h. It allows the user to compile C code with a CXX
  compiler without including the CXX bindings.
- PERUSE support has been added. In order to activate it add
  --enable-peruse to the configure options. All events described in
  the PERUSE 2.0 draft are supported, plus one Open MPI
  extension. PERUSE_COMM_REQ_XFER_CONTINUE allow to see how the data
  is segmented internally, using multiple interfaces or the pipeline
  engine. However, this version only support one event of each type
  simultaneously attached to a communicator.
- Add support for running jobs in heterogeneous environments.
  Currently supports environments with different endianness and
  different representations of C++ bool and Fortran LOGICAL.
  Mismatched sizes for other datatypes is not supported.
- Open MPI now includes an implementation of the MPI-2 One-Sided
  Communications specification.
- Open MPI is now configurable in cross-compilation environments.
  Several Fortran 77 and Fortran 90 tests need to be pre-seeded with
  results from a config.cache-like file.
- Add --debug option to mpirun to generically invoke a parallel debugger.

  network (typically resulting in deadlock).  Thanks to Ken Mighell
  for pointing this out to us.
- Change the behavior of orterun (mpirun, mpirexec) to search for

  not only on the predefined types boundaries. Thanks to Yvan Fournier

- Fixes for some cases where the use of MPI_BOTTOM could cause
  problems.

  queue support (such as the one shipped by SilverStorm / Infinicon
  for OS X).

- Fixed a problem with message matching of out-of-order fragments in
