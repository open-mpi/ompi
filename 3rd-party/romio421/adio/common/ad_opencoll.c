 * optimization: by having just one process create a file, close it,
 * then have all N processes open it, we can possibly avoid contention
 * for write locks on a directory for some file systems.
 *
 * Happy side-effect: exclusive create (error if file already exists)
 * just falls out
 *
 * Note: this is not a "scalable open" (c.f. "The impact of file systems
