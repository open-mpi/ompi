/*@
  MPL_wtime - Return a time stamp

  Output Parameter:
. timeval - A pointer to an 'MPL_wtime_t' variable.

  Notes:
  This routine returns an `opaque` time value.  This difference between two
  time values returned by 'MPL_wtime' can be converted into an elapsed time
  in seconds with the routine 'MPL_wtime_diff'.

  This routine is defined this way to simplify its implementation as a macro.
  For example, the for Intel x86 and gcc,
.vb
#define MPL_wtime(timeval) \
     __asm__ __volatile__("rdtsc" : "=A" (*timeval))
.ve

  For some purposes, it is important
  that the timer calls change the timing of the code as little as possible.
  This form of a timer routine provides for a very fast timer that has
  minimal impact on the rest of the code.

  From a semantic standpoint, this format emphasizes that any particular
  timer value has no meaning; only the difference between two values is
  meaningful.

  Module:
  Timer

  Question:
  MPI-2 allows 'MPI_Wtime' to be a macro.  We should make that easy; this
  version does not accomplish that.

  MPL_wtime_diff - Compute the difference between two time stamps

  Input Parameters:
. t1, t2 - Two time values set by 'MPL_wtime' on this process.


  Output Parameter:
. diff - The different in time between t2 and t1, measured in seconds.

  Note:
  If 't1' is null, then 't2' is assumed to be differences accumulated with
  'MPL_wtime_acc', and the output value gives the number of seconds that
  were accumulated.

  Question:
  Instead of handling a null value of 't1', should we have a separate
  routine 'MPL_wtime_todouble' that converts a single timestamp to a
  double value?

  Notes:
  This routine is used to accumulate the time spent with a block of code
  without first converting the time stamps into a particular arithmetic
  type such as a 'double'.  For example, if the 'MPL_wtime' routine accesses
  a cycle counter, this routine (or macro) can perform the accumulation using
  integer arithmetic.

  To convert a time value accumulated with this routine, use 'MPL_wtime_diff'
  with a 't1' of zero.
