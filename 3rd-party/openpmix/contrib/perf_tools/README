Building instructions:

* Open the Makefile and fix the following variables:
  * PMIX_BASE should point to the directory where PMIx is installed.
    If you don't want to test PMIx - remove pmix from the list of "all" targets.
  * PMI2_BASE should point to the directory where SLURM is installed.
    If you don't want to test PMI2 - remove pmi2 from the list of "all" targets.
* run `make`.

The following files (or one of them) will be built as the result:
* pmix_intra_perf - that is for testing pmix performance
- pmi2_intra_perf - for testing pmi2 performance

Running instructions:

The following options are supported by both of the binaries:
  -s, --key-size=<size>     size of the key's submitted (default is 100 * sizeof(int) bytes)
  -c, --key-count=<size>    number of keys submitted to local and remote parts (default is 10)
  -d, --direct-modex        use direct modex if available
  --debug                   force all processes to print out the timings themself

You can run it directly with your favorite launcher (mpirun/srun), just
make sure that both MPI and PMIx libraries are visible for the loader.

For PMIx testing "convenience" there is a `run.sh` script that can be used to
ensure that environment is set properly (not a production grade so may not work
for all environments). To use it open it and fix:
- OMPI_BASE to point to your MPI installation
- PMIX_LIB to point to your PMIx installation

If you are running inside the supported batch system you should be fine to
just run fixed `run.sh` with the first argument defining how many processes
needs to be launched and all other parameters will be passed to the performance
tool. For example:
$ ./run.sh 10 -d
