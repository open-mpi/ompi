# OpenPMIx

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/openpmix/openpmix.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/openpmix/openpmix)

## Official documentation

The OpenPMIx documentation can be viewed in the following ways:

1. Online at https://docs.openpmix.org/
1. In self-contained (i.e., suitable for local viewing, without an
   internet connection) in official distribution tarballs under
   `docs/_build/html/index.html`.

## Building the documentation locally

The source code for OpenPMIx's docs can be found in the OpenPMIx Git
repository under the `docs` folder.

Developers who clone the OpenPMIx Git repository will not have the
HTML documentation and man pages by default; it must be built.
Instructions for how to build the OpenPMIx documentation can be found
here:
https://docs.openpmix.org/en/latest/developers/prerequisites.html#sphinx-and-therefore-python.

## Security policy

The OpenPMIx security policy can be viewed online at https://docs.openpmix.org/en/latest/security.html.

NOTE: any potential security issue should be reported immediately to us at security@pmix.org
