PMIx was unable to find a usable compression library
on the system. We will therefore be unable to compress
large data streams. This may result in longer-than-normal
startup times and larger memory footprints. We will
continue, but strongly recommend installing zlib or
a comparable compression library for better user experience.

You can suppress this warning by adding "pcompress_base_silence_warning=1"
to your PMIx MCA default parameter file, or by adding
"PMIX_MCA_pcompress_base_silence_warning=1" to your environment.
