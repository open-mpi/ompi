#
[static-and-dynamic]
Both static and dynamic port ranges were specified for the
PMIx communication subsystem:

Static ports:   %s
Dynamic ports:  %s

Only one can be specified. Please choose either static or
dynamic ports and try again.
#
[include-exclude]
Both TCP interface include and exclude lists were specified:

  Include: %s
  Exclude: %s

Only one of these can be given.
#
[not-parseable]
The specified network is not parseable. Since we cannot determine
your desired intent, we cannot establish a TCP socket for PMIx
communications and will therefore abort. Please correct the network
specification and retry.
#
[no-included-found]
None of the TCP networks specified to be included for communications
could be found:

  Value given: %s

Please revise the specification and try again.
#
[excluded-all]
The specified list of networks to be excluded for TCP communications
resulted in no networks being available:

  Value given: %s

Please revise the specification and try again.
#
[invalid if_inexclude]
WARNING: An invalid value was given for pmix_ptl_base_if_%s.  This
value will be ignored.

  Local host: %s
  Value:      %s
  Message:    %s
#
[authent-fail]
An attempt was made to make a TCP connection between two hosts:

  Initiating host:  %s
  Receiving host:   %s

Unfortunately, the connection was refused due to a failure to
authenticate. This is usually caused by a mismatch between
the security domains of the two hosts - e.g., one might be
using Munge while the other is not. This can typically be
resolved by specifying the desired security method. For
example, adding "--mca psec native" to your command line.
#
[accept failed]
WARNING: The accept(3) system call failed on a TCP socket.  While this
should generally never happen on a well-configured HPC system, the
most common causes when it does occur are:

  * The process ran out of file descriptors
  * The operating system ran out of file descriptors
  * The operating system ran out of memory

Your job may hang until the failure reason is fixed
(e.g., more file descriptors and/or memory becomes available), and may
eventually timeout / abort.

  Local host:     %s
  Errno:          %d (%s)
  Probable cause: %s
#
[privilege failure]
An attempt was made to initiate a TCP connection from an
unprivileged source while we are operating at privileged
levels.

  Local host:      %s
  Listening port:  %d
  Remote host:     %s
  Remote port:    %d

The connection was rejected.
#
[no-listeners]
No sockets were able to be opened on the available protocols
(IPv4 and/or IPv6). Please check your network and retry.
#
[too-many-conns]
PMIx has found multiple possible servers to which it could
connect. Further guidance is required to ensure the connection
is made to a desirable server. Guidance can be in the form
of the namespace or PID of a specific server, a directive to
connect to a system server, a specific URI to use, or the name
of a rendezvous file.

Some connection handles have been read from files named pmix.*
in subdirectories of $TMPDIR; delete them if they are stale.
