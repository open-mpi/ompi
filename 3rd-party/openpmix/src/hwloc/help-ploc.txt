PMIx was not able to find any usable hardware topology
components. This could be due to not finding a suitable
supporting library such as HWLOC. PMIx requires access
to topology information due to its increased role in
providing information on critical areas such as device
distances and fabric interfaces.

Please reconfigure PMIx with a hardware topology library
of your choice.
