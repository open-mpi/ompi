   --param <arg0>:<arg1>,<arg2>      Show MCA parameters.  The first parameter is the framework (or the
                                     keyword "all"); the second parameter is a comma-delimited list of
                                     specific component names (if only <arg0> is given, then all
                                     components will be reported).

[not-found]
The specified framework could not be found:

  Framework: %s

This could be due to a misspelling of the framework name, or because support
for that framework was not configured into this version of orte. Please see
