PMIx v4.x series
================

This file contains all the NEWS updates for the PMIx v4.x
series, in reverse chronological order.

4.2.6 -- 9 Sep 2023
----------------------
.. warning:: CVE-2023-41915

    A security issue was reported by Fran√ßois Diakhate (CEA)
    which is addressed in the PMIx v4.2.6 and v5.0.1 releases.
    (Older PMIx versions may be vulnerable, but are no longer
    supported.)

    A filesystem race condition could permit a malicious user
    to obtain ownership of an arbitrary file on the filesystem
    when parts of the PMIx library are called by a process
    running as uid 0. This may happen under the default
    configuration of certain workload managers, including Slurm.

4.2.0 -- 20 Aug 2022
--------------------
.. important:: This release includes a number of new features that
               may be of use to library and application developers. These include:

                 * support for qualified values - i.e., the ability to reuse an
                   attribute, assigning it different values with each value
                   contingent upon one or more qualifiers. Thus, requests to
                   return the value can specify the corresponding qualifiers
                   to identify the specific version of the value being requested.
                 * provide additional information to be included in group construct
                   operations. The result of the operation shall include exchange
                   of such information with all participants, with the information
                   "qualified" by the assigned group context ID.
                 * new output formats that allow prepending output streams with
                   the hostname and pid of the source process
                 * improved support for tools that allow connection to multiple
                   simultaneous servers and better handshakes for establishing
                   connections
                 * fixes for access to session/node/app-realm information
                 * broader support for pretty-print of PMIx structures such
                   as pmix_info_t and pmix_value_t
                 * compliance with the new PMIx ABI definitions. This includes
                   converting some macros to functions, with macros retained
                   for backward compatibility
                 * capture and forwarding of default MCA parameter file values,
                   both from the system and user level

4.1.2 -- 11 Feb 2022
--------------------
.. important:: This release contains a workaround that resolves the prior
               conflict with HWLOC versions 2.5.0 through 2.7.0 (inclusive).
               Those versions of HWLOC are now supported.

- PR #2453: Avoid string literals in environ
  - Be defensive against string literals in env
  - Remove block of hwloc 2.5 - 2.7
  - Adjust Mellanox CI Dockerfile so it can build


4.1.1 -- 1 Feb 2022
-------------------
.. important:: As of v4.1.1, PMIx includes an EXCEPTIONS file that lists
               all deviations from the PMIx Standard. This primarily includes
               extensions that have not yet been adopted by the Standard.

.. important:: As of v4.1.1, PMIx no longer has a dependency on "pandoc"
               for building and installing man pages.

.. warning:: PMIx has identified a bug in HWLOC versions 2.5.0 thru
             2.7.0 (inclusive) that causes PMIx to segfault during certain
             operations. We have worked with the HWLOC developers to fix
             that problem, and the fix will be included beginning in HWLOC
             version 2.7.1. Accordingly, PMIx now checks for the problem
             HWLOC versions and will error out of configure if they are
             encountered.

4.0.0 -- 30 Dec 2020
--------------------
.. important:: This release implements the complete PMIx v4.0 Standard
               and therefore includes a number of new APIs and features. These
               are fully documented in the official document - the details of
               the revisions included in v4.0 are summarized here:
               https://pmix.github.io/uploads/2020/12/pmix-standard-4.0.pdf#page=549
               Note that this version of OpenPMIx includes a first-cut at the
               Python bindings described in Appendix A of the v4.0 Standard.

Beyond the v4.0 modifications and additions to APIs, datatypes, attributes,
and macros, changes to the library include:

 - Removal of the usock messaging component - only TCP is now supported
 - Removal of the PMI-1 and PMI-2 backward compatibility libraries into
   a new separate repository
 - Packaging changes to push the headers into ``*-devel`` packages
 - libtool patch for Mac BigSur OS
 - Fixed dependency issue with HWLOC to protect against stone-age versions
 - Changed man page format to Markdown, requires pandoc to generate from
   Git repository (but not from tarball)
 - Enable local fork/exec by tools when not connected to a server - this
   is done transparently
 - Support reproducible builds
 - Multiple bug fixes and memory leak repairs
 - Add support for network interface and GPU device distances
 - Allow retrieval of the caller's own rank and process ID via PMIx_Get
 - Provide full delineation of client, server, and tool attribute support
 - Add support for libev in lieu of libevent
 - Detect/avoid conflict with LSF version of "libevent"
 - Auto-detect and forward envars from various identified programming models
   (e.g., OpenMPI, OpenSHMEM) and fabrics
 - Change the default component build behavior to prefer building components
   as part of libpmix.so instead of individual DSOs.
