   This page serves as a high level NEWS page which includes NEWS
   from various PMIx series

News
====

This file contains the main features as well as overviews of specific
bug fixes (and other actions) for each version of PMIx since
version 1.0.

As more fully described in the :ref:`Software Version Number section
<label-version-numbers>`,
PMIx typically releases two separate version
series simultaneously.  Since these series have different goals and
are semi-independent of each other, a single NEWS-worthy item may be
introduced into different series at different times.  For example,
feature F was introduced in the vA.B series at version vA.B.C, and was
later introduced into the vX.Y series at vX.Y.Z.

The first time feature F is released, the item will be listed in the
vA.B.C section, denoted as:

   (** also to appear: X.Y.Z) -- indicating that this item is also
                                 likely to be included in future release
                                 version vX.Y.Z.

When vX.Y.Z is later released, the same NEWS-worthy item will also be
included in the vX.Y.Z section and be denoted as:

   (** also appeared: A.B.C)  -- indicating that this item was previously
                                     included in release version vA.B.C.
