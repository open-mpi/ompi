Getting help
============

Found a bug?  Got a question?  Want to make a suggestion?  Want to
contribute to OpenPMIx?  Please let us know!

Many common questions about building and using OpenPMIx are answered
in these documents. If they aren't enough, questions and comments should generally be
posted to the `OpenPMIx GitHub issue tracker
<https://github.com/openpmix/openpmix/issues>`_.

Alternatively, questions can also be sent to the `OpenPMIx mailing list
<https://groups.google.com/d/forum/pmix>`_
(pmix@googlegroups.com).  Because of spam, only subscribers are
allowed to post to this list (ensure that you subscribe with and post
from *exactly* the same e-mail address -- joe@example.com is
considered different than joe@mycomputer.example.com!).

When submitting questions and problems, be sure to include as much
extra information as possible. A list of requested information is
provided in the "issues" template.
