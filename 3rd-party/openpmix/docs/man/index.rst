OpenPMIx manual pages
=====================

All of the content in this section is also installed as individual
manual ("man") pages in a OpenPMIx installation.  If your man page search
path includes the location where OpenPMIx installed its man pages (which
defaults to ``$prefix/share/man``), you can invoke commands similar to
the following to see the same content that you see in these HTML
pages:

.. code:: sh

   shell$ man PMIx_Abort

OpenPMIx man pages, by section:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   man1/index
   man3/index
   man5/index
