``configure`` output summary
============================

At the end of ``configure``, a summary of many configuration options
are shown.

The PMIx Team *highly* recommends examining the ``configure``
summary to validate that PMIx plans to build all the features that
you expect it to build.

If the summary does not agree with what you think should be done, you
can look earlier in ``configure``'s output to see why particular
options and behaviors were selected.
