The files in this directory are sample PMIx applications provided both
as a trivial primer to PMIx as well as simple tests to ensure that your
PMIx Reference Server (PSVR) installation is working properly:

client.c:
A simple PMIx client that attaches to the server and performs a few
simple PMIx_Get calls following a blocking fence operation that returns
all collected data from calls to PMIx_Put.

debugger.c:
Mimics a debugger tool. Contacts the PSVR to obtain
nspace information and displays it. Takes user input as to the application
to be "debugged", and then instructs PSVR to launch the companion
"debuggerd" daemons on the nodes where the application is running. The
daemons then connect to the local PSVR daemon and issue a "breakpoint"
notification so the application knows the debugger has attached and is
released from its barrier. The debugger then cleans up and quits.

dmodex.c:
A simple PMIx client that attaches to the server and performs a few
simple PMIx_Get calls following a blocking fence operation that has
been directed _not_ to return any collected data from calls to PMIx_Put.

dynamic.c:


The Makefile assumes that the pcc wrapper compiler is in your path.

Make today a PMIx day!
