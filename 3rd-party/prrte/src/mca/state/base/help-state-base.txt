The runtime option NOTIFYERRORS was set to true. This requests that the
runtime provide a PMIx event whenever a job encounters an error - e.g., a
process fails. The event is to be delivered to each remaining process in
the job. However, this only can be done if the job is not to be terminated
in the event of an error. The following runtime options govern that
behavior:

    RECOVERABLE[=(bool)] if set to true, this indicates that the application
    wishes to consider the job as recoverable - i.e., the application is
    assuming responsibility for recovering from any process failure. This
    could include application-driven spawn of a substitute process or
    internal compensation for the missing process. This option defaults to
    a true value if the option is given without a value.

    CONTINUOUS[=(bool)] if set to true, this informs the runtime that the
    processes in this job are to run until explicitly terminated. Processes
    that fail are to be automatically restarted up to "max restarts"
    number of times. Notification of process failure is to be delivered
    to all processes in the application. This is the equivalent of specifying
    RECOVERABLE, NOTIFYERRORS, and AUTORESTART options except that the runtime,
    not the application, assumes responsibility for process recovery. This
    option defaults to a true value if the option is given without a value.

You must specify one of the above in combination with NOTIFYERRORS in order
to receive notifications of errors. Please correct the situation and try again.
