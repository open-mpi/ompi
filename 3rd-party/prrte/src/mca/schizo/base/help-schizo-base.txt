#
[bad-param-line]
Parsing error in variable file:

  FILE:  %s
  LINE:  %s

Please correct and try again.
#
[incorrect-env-list-param]
WARNING: The format of "mca_base_env_list" parameter is a delimited list of VAR=VAL or
VAR instances. By default, the delimiter is a semicolon: VAR1=VAL1;VAR2;VAR3=VAL3;...
You can set other via "mca_base_env_list_delimiter" parameter. If the delimiter is a
semicolon, the value of "mca_base_env_list" variable should be quoted to not interfere
with SHELL command line parsing. In the case where a value is not assigned to variable
VAR, the value will be taken from the current environment.
The following environment variable was not found in the environment:
  Variable:             %s
  MCA variable value:   %s
#
[env-not-found]
An environmental variable was requested to be forwarded, but was not found:

  Variable:  %s

This may result in unexpected behavior.
#
[single-dash-error]
WARNING: All multi-character command line options must be prefixed with double
dashes, not a single dash:

  Deprecated option(s):   %s
  Corrected  option(s):   %s

We have updated this for you and will proceed. However, this will be treated
as an error in a future release. Please update your command line.
#
[deprecated-converted]
WARNING: A deprecated command line option was used.

  Deprecated option:   %s
  Corrected option:    %s

We have updated this for you and will proceed. However, this will be treated
as an error in a future release. Please update your command line.
#
[deprecated-inform]
WARNING: A deprecated command line option was used.

  Deprecated option:   %s
  Reason: %s
#
[deprecated-fail]
WARNING: A deprecated command line option was used. It is unclear how to update
this option. Please contact the community for how best to resolve this issue.

  Deprecated option:   %s
  Reason: %s

We are not able to proceed. Please update your command line.
#
[bad-ppr]
The proc-per-resource request is not correct. The request must include both
the number of procs for each resource and the type of resource to be used.

  Specified option:  %s

We are not able to proceed. Please correct your command line.
#
[bad-stream-buffering-value]
An incorrect value for the "--stream-buffering" option was given:

  Specified value:  %d

Valid values are limited to 0, 1, or 2. Your application will continue, but
please correct your command line in the future.
#
[missing-envar-param]
Warning: Could not find the environment variable: %s
#
[duplicate-mca-value]
Error: an MCA parameter was listed more than once on the command line, or
multiple times in one or more files, but with conflicting values:

  Param:  %s
  Value:  %s
  Value:  %s

We cannot determine which value was intended, and therefore are unable to proceed.
Please correct your command line.
#
[multi-instances]
ERROR: The "%s" command line option was listed more than once on the command line.
Only one instance of this option is permitted.
Please correct your command line.
#
[no-proxy]
ERROR: %s was unable to identify the proxy for your command.

  Option specified: %s

Please specify a personality or ask the library developer's to address
the problem.
#
[unrecog-generic-param]
The command line contains a generic MCA param that is not
recognized by either the default or active personalities:

  Param name:   %s
  Param value:  %s

Please modify the command line to either specify the personality
this parameter belongs to (e.g., "--prtemca" for a PRRTE param,
"--pmixmca" for a PMIx param, "--omca" for an OMPI param) or
ensure that the generic param is correct and known to the active
personality.
#
[too-many-instances]
The command line includes too many instances of the following option:

  Command line: %s
  Option: %s
  Number of instances: %d
  Allowed number: %d

Please correct the command line and try again.
#
[too-many-directives]
When resolving deprecated command line options, the result generated
too many directives for the target option:

  Command line option: %s
  Initial value: %s
  Deprecated option: %s %s

Please correct the command line and try again.
#
[too-many-values]
When resolving deprecated command line options, the following
command line option has more than one value:

  Option: %s

The resolution function cannot handle this scenario - please
notify the developers
#
[binding-pe-conflict]
The PE=<list> mapping directive cannot be combined with a
binding directive other than "core" or "hwt" as it already
mandates that we bind to the specified cpu(s). The conflicting
directives that were given are:

  map-by:  %s
  bind-to: %s

Please resolve the conflict and try again.
#
[missing-values]
The provided command line option requires passing two
values:

  Option:  %s <MCA param name> <param value>

Please provide the missing values and try again.
#
[non-supporting-pmix]
The given command line directive is technically valid, but the
underlying PMIx version being employed lacks the necessary attribute
definitions to support it.

  Directive:  %s
  Option:     %s

We are therefore unable to satisfy this request.
