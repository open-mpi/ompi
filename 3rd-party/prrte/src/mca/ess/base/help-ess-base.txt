[ess-base:execv-error]
The singleton application was not able to find the executable "orted" in
your PATH or in the directory where PRTE was initially installed,
and therefore cannot continue.

For reference, we tried the following command:

  %s

and got the error %s.

This could mean that your PATH or executable name is wrong, or that you do not
have the necessary permissions.  Please ensure that the executable is able to be
found and executed as it is required for singleton operations.
[ess-base:cannot-forward]
The system does not support trapping and forwarding of the
specified signal:

  signal: %s
  param:  %s

Please remove that signal from the ess_base_forward_signals MCA parameter.
[ess-base:unknown-signal]
The following signal was included in the ess_base_forward_signals
MCA parameter:

  signal: %s
  param:  %s

This is not a recognized signal value. Please fix or remove it.
#
[slurm-error]
The application appears to have been direct launched using "srun",
but OMPI was not built with SLURM's PMI support and therefore cannot
execute. There are several options for building PMI support under
SLURM, depending upon the SLURM version you are using:

  version 16.05 or later: you can use SLURM's PMIx support. This
  requires that you configure and build SLURM --with-pmix.

  Versions earlier than 16.05: you must use either SLURM's PMI-1 or
  PMI-2 support. SLURM builds PMI-1 by default, or you can manually
  install PMI-2. You must then build PRTE using --with-pmi pointing
  to the SLURM PMI library location.

Please configure as appropriate and try again.
#
[slurm-error2]
The application appears to have been direct launched using "srun",
but OMPI was not built with SLURM support. This usually happens
when OMPI was not configured --with-slurm and we weren't able
to discover a SLURM installation in the usual places.

Please configure as appropriate and try again.
#
[alps-error]
The application appears to have been direct launched using "aprun",
but OMPI was not built with ALPS PMI support and therefore cannot
execute. You must build PRTE using --with-pmi pointing
to the ALPS PMI library location.

Please configure as appropriate and try again.
#
[alps-error2]
The application appears to have been direct launched using "aprun",
but OMPI was not built with ALPS support. This usually happens
when OMPI was not configured --with-alps and we weren't able
to discover an ALPS installation in the usual places.

Please configure as appropriate and try again.
#
[legacy-tool]
We no longer support non-PMIx-based tools, and require a
minimum level of PMIx v2.0.

Please update the tool and/or the PMIx version you are using.
