[prte-rmaps-rr:multi-apps-and-zero-np]
RMAPS found multiple applications to be launched, with
at least one that failed to specify the number of processes to execute.
When specifying multiple applications, you must specify how many processes
of each to launch via the -np argument.
#
[prte-rmaps-rr:per-node-and-too-many-procs]
There are not enough nodes in your allocation to satisfy your request to launch
%d processes on a per-node basis - only %d nodes were available.

Either request fewer processes, or obtain a larger allocation.
#
[prte-rmaps-rr:n-per-node-and-too-many-procs]
There are not enough nodes in your allocation to satisfy your request to launch
%d processes on a %d per-node basis - only %d nodes with a total of %d slots were available.

Either request fewer processes, or obtain a larger allocation.
[prte-rmaps-rr:n-per-node-and-not-enough-slots]
There are not enough slots on the nodes in your allocation to satisfy your request to launch on a %d process-per-node basis - only %d slots/node were available.

Either request fewer processes/node, or obtain a larger allocation.
#
[prte-rmaps-rr:no-np-and-user-map]
You have specified a rank-to-node/slot mapping, but failed to provide
the number of processes to be executed. For some reason, this information
could not be obtained from the mapping you provided, so we cannot continue
with executing the specified application.
#
[prte-rmaps-rr:not-enough-objs]
There are not enough resources on the available nodes
to meet the requested mapping.

  Application: %s
  Number of procs:  %d
  Number of resources: %d
#
[prte-rmaps-rr:not-enough-cpus]
There are not enough slots available in the system or not enough
CPUs in the specified PE-LIST to map the number of processes requested
by the application:

  app:  %s
  Number of procs: %d
  pe-list: %s

Either request fewer procs for your application, make more slots
available for use, or expand the pe-list.

A "slot" is the PRRTE term for an allocatable unit where we can
launch a process.  The number of slots available are defined by the
environment in which PRRTE processes are run:

  1. Hostfile, via "slots=N" clauses (N defaults to number of
     processor cores if not provided)
  2. The --host command line parameter, via a ":N" suffix on the
     hostname (N defaults to 1 if not provided)
  3. Resource manager (e.g., SLURM, PBS/Torque, LSF, etc.)
  4. If none of a hostfile, the --host command line parameter, or an
     RM is present, PRRTE defaults to the number of processor cores

In all the above cases, if you want PRRTE to default to the number
of hardware threads instead of the number of processor cores, use the
--use-hwthread-cpus option.

Alternatively, you can use the --map-by :OVERSUBSCRIBE option to ignore
the number of available slots and size of the pe-list when placing the
processes.
