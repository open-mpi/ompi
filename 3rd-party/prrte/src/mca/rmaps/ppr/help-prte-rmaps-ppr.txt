[invalid-ppr]
An invalid value was given for the number of processes
per resource (ppr) to be mapped on each node:

  PPR:  %s

The specification must be a comma-separated list containing
combinations of number, followed by a colon, followed
by the resource type. For example, a value of "1:package" indicates that
one process is to be mapped onto each package. Values are supported
for "hwthread", "core", "package",
"l1cache", "l2cache", "l3cache", and "node" . Note that
enough characters must be provided to clearly specify the desired
resource (e.g., "l1" for "l1cache").
#
[unrecognized-ppr-option]
An unrecognized value was given for the number of processes
per resource (ppr) to be mapped on each node:

  Value:  %s
  PPR:  %s

The specification must be a number, followed by a colon, followed
by the resource type. For example, a value of "1:slot" indicates that
anything over one process per slot is to be considered oversubscribed.
Only values for "hwthread", "core", "package",
"l1cache", "l2cache", "l3cache", and "node" are allowed. Note that
enough characters must be provided to clearly specify the desired
resource (e.g., "l1" for "l1cache").
#
[ppr-violation]
The provided mapping directives resulted in too many processes
being placed on a node:

  Node:  %s
  Num procs:  %d
  Limiting resource:  %s
  Num resources:  %d
  Specified constraint:  %s

Please adjust and try again.
#
[ppr-too-many-procs]
Your job has requested more processes than the ppr for
this topology can support:

  App: %s
  Number of procs:  %d
  Procs mapped:  %d
  Total number of procs:  %d
  PPR: %s

Please revise the conflict and try again.
#
[ppr-topo-missing]
A ppr pattern was specified, but the topology information
for the following node is missing:

  Node:  %s
