[prte-rmaps-seq:resource-not-found]
The specified sequence file contained a node (%s) that is not in your
allocation. We therefore cannot map a process rank to it. Please
check your allocation and sequence file to ensure the latter only
contains allocated nodes.
#
[seq:not-enough-resources]
A sequential map was requested, but not enough node entries
were given to support the requested number of processes:

  Num procs:  %d
  Num nodes:  %d

The sequential mapper requires that there be a node entry for
every process in the job, and it processes the provided file
using each node entry to identify the node where that numbered
rank is to be placed.

Note that you can provide a separate sequence file (different
from a hostfile that specifies the number of slots on each node)
for use by the sequential mapper in its assignments by using the
appropriate modifier:

  Example: --map-by seq:file=myseqfile
#
[missing-cpu]
While parsing the sequential hostfile, %s encountered a line that
specified a non-existent CPU:

  Slots: %s
  Available CPUs: %s

Please correct the line and try again.
#
[bad-syntax]
Error, invalid syntax in sequential hostfile %s.

The sequential mapper requires that there be a node entry for
every process in the job, and it processes the provided file
using each node entry to identify the node where that numbered
rank is to be placed. You can specify the CPU binding for the
process on its node entry line in the following manner:

A 1:0,1   # put this rank on node A, bound to socket 1, CPUs 0 and 1
B 1-4     # put this rank on node B, bound to CPUs 1-4

Please correct the syntax and try again.
#
[proc-failed-to-map]
A process could not be mapped:

  Hostname: %s
  App: %s

Could not continue.
