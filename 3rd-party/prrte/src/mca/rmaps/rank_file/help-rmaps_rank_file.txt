[no-rankfile]
%s was unable to open the rankfile:
  Filename: %s
Check to make sure the path and filename are correct.

usage:  %s -mca rmaps_rankfile_path rankfile ./app

Examples of proper syntax include:
  cat hostfile
    host1
    host2
    host3
    host4
  cat rankfile
    rank 1=host1 slot=1:0,1
    rank 0=host2 slot=0:*
    rank 2=host4 slot=1-2
    rank 3=host3 slot=0:1;1:0-2
#
[bad-host]
The rankfile that was used claimed that a host was either not
allocated or oversubscribed its slots.  Please review your rank-slot
assignments and your host allocation to ensure a proper match.  Also,
some systems may require using full hostnames, such as
"host1.example.com" (instead of just plain "host1").

  Host: %s
#
[bad-index]
Rankfile claimed host %s by index that is bigger than number of allocated hosts.
#
[bad-assign]
Error, rank %d is already assigned to %s, check %s
#
[bad-syntax]
Error, invalid syntax in the rankfile (%s)
syntax must be the following

rank i=host_i slot=string

Examples of proper syntax include:
    rank 1=host1 slot=1:0,1
    rank 0=host2 slot=0:*
    rank 2=host4 slot=1-2
    rank 3=host3 slot=0:1;1:0-2
#
[missing-rank]
A rank is missing its location specification:

  Rank:        %d
  Rank file:   %s

All processes must have their location specified in the rank file. Either
add an entry to the file, or provide a default slot_list to use for
any unspecified ranks.
#
[missing-cpu]
While parsing the rankfile, %s encountered a line that specified
a non-existent CPU:

  Slots: %s
  Available CPUs: %s

Please correct the line and try again.
[lsf-affinity-file-not-found]
The affinity file provided in LSB_AFFINITY_HOSTFILE could not be found:

  File:  %s

We cannot continue.
[lsf-affinity-file-failed-convert]
The affinity file provided in LSB_AFFINITY_HOSTFILE could not be converted
to a rankfile:

  File:  %s

We cannot continue.
[rmaps:proc-slots-overloaded]
A process attempted to bind to resources already allocated on a node
to a different process.
 Process : %s
 Node    : %s
 Process Requested CPU Set : %s
 Node Available CPU Set    : %s
 Overlapping CPU Set       : %s

If this is intentional then you must pass the "overload-allowed"
qualifier to the --bind-to option.
  --bind-to :overload-allowed
