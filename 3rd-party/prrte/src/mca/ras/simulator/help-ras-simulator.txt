[no hwloc support for topofiles]
The ras_simulator_topo_files MCA parameter was specified, but this
PRTE installation has no "hwloc" support, meaning that topo files
cannot be used.

Your job will now abort.
#
[hwloc API fail]
An internal hwloc API call failed in the RAS simulator module.  This
is unusual, and should likely be reported to the PRTE developers.

Your job will now abort.

[hwloc failed to load xml]
The RAS simulator module failed to load an XML topology file.  This
usually means that the file is either invalid or does not exist.
