Process placement
=================

PRRTE provides a set of three controls for assigning process
locations and ranks:

#. Mapping: Assigns a default location to each process
#. Ranking: Assigns a unique integer rank value to each process
#. Binding: Constrains each process to run on specific processors

The sections below describe these controls in more detail.
