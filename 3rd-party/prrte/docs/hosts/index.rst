Host specification
==================

PRRTE identifies hosts on which to launch processes by:

#. A Resource Manager (RM) telling PRRTE which hosts to use
#. The user providing a hostfile (also sometimes called a "machine
   file")
#. The user providing a list of hosts on the command line

The sections below describe each of these in more detail.
