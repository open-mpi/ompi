PRRTE manual pages
==================

All of the content in this section is also installed as individual
manual ("man") pages in a PRRTE installation.  If your man page search
path includes the location where PRRTE installed its man pages (which
defaults to ``$prefix/share/man``), you can invoke commands similar to
the following to see the same content that you see in these HTML
pages:

.. code:: sh

   shell$ man prterun

PRRTE man pages, by section:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   man1/index
   man5/index
