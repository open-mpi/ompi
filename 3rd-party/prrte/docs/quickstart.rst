Quick start
===========

In many cases, PRRTE can be built and installed by simply
indicating the installation directory on the command line:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ tar xf prrte-<version>.tar.bz2
   $ cd prrte-<version>
   $ ./configure --prefix=<path> |& tee config.out
   ...lots of output...
   $ make -j 8 |& tee make.out
   ...lots of output...
   $ make install |& tee install.out
   ...lots of output...

Note that there are many, many configuration options to the
``./configure`` step.  Some of them may be needed for your particular
environmnet; see below for desciptions of the options available.

If your installation prefix path is not writable by a regular user,
you may need to use ``sudo`` or ``su`` to run the ``make install``
step.  For example:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ sudo make install |& tee install.out
   [sudo] password for builduser: <enter your password here>
   ...lots of output...

Finally, note that VPATH builds are fully supported.  For example:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ tar xf prrte-<version>.tar.bz2
   $ cd prrte-<version>
   $ mkdir build
   $ cd build
   $ ../configure --prefix=<path> |& tee config.out
   ...etc.
