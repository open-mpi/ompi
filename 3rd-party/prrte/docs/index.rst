PMIx Reference Runtime Environment (PRRTE) |prte_ver|
=====================================================

The project is formally referred to in documentation by "PRRTE", and
the GitHub repository is ``prrte``.

.. note:: We have found that most users do not like typing the two
          consecutive ``r`` letters in the name. Hence, all of the
          internal API symbols, environment variables, MCA frameworks,
          and CLI executables all use the abbreviated ``prte`` (one
          ``r``, not two) for convenience.
