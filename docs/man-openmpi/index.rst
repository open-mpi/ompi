Open MPI manual pages
=====================

All of the content in this section is also installed as individual
manual ("man") pages in an Open MPI installation.  If your man page
search path includes the location where Open MPI installed its man
pages (which defaults to ``$prefix/share/man``), you can invoke
commands similar to the following to see the same content that you see
in these HTML pages:

.. code:: sh

   shell$ man MPI_Send

Open MPI man pages, by section:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   man1/index
   man3/index
   man7/index
