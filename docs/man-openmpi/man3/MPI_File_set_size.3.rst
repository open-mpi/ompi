:ref:`MPI_File_set_size` - Resizes a file (collective).


SYNTAX
------



C Syntax
^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: c

   #include <mpi.h>

   int MPI_File_set_size(MPI_File fh, MPI_Offset size)


Fortran Syntax
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: fortran

   USE MPI
   ! or the older form: INCLUDE 'mpif.h'
   MPI_FILE_SET_SIZE(FH, SIZE, IERROR)
   	INTEGER	FH, IERROR
   	INTEGER(KIND=MPI_OFFSET_KIND)	SIZE


Fortran 2008 Syntax
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: fortran

   USE mpi_f08
   MPI_File_set_size(fh, size, ierror)
   	TYPE(MPI_File), INTENT(IN) :: fh
   	INTEGER(KIND=MPI_OFFSET_KIND), INTENT(IN) :: size
   	INTEGER, OPTIONAL, INTENT(OUT) :: ierror


INPUT PARAMETERS
----------------
* ``fh``: File handle (handle).
* ``size``: Size to truncate or expand file (integer).

OUTPUT PARAMETER
----------------
* ``ierror``: Fortran only: Error status (integer).

DESCRIPTION
-----------

:ref:`MPI_File_set_size` resizes the file associated with the file handle *fh,*
truncating UNIX files as necessary. :ref:`MPI_File_set_size` is collective; all
processes in the group must pass identical values for size.

When using :ref:`MPI_File_set_size` on a UNIX file, if *size* is larger than
the current file size, the file size becomes *size*. If *size* is
smaller than the current file size, the file is truncated at the
position defined by *size* (from the beginning of the file and measured
in bytes). Regions of the file which have been previously written are
unaffected.

:ref:`MPI_File_set_size` does not affect the individual file pointers or the
shared file pointer.

Note that the actual amount of storage space cannot be allocated by
:ref:`MPI_File_set_size`. Use :ref:`MPI_File_preallocate` to accomplish this.

It is erroneous to call this function if MPI_MODE_SEQUENTIAL mode was
specified when the file was opened.
