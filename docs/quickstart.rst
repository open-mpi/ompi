Quick start
===========

There are three general phases of using Open MPI: installing Open MPI,
building MPI applications, and running MPI applications.

The links below take you to "quick start" sections at the beginning of
each chapter.  These "quick start" sections provide a good starting
point, and may be all that many users need to read.  However, if the
"quick start" sections are not enough, the remainder of each chapter
provides significantly more detailed information.
