OpenSHMEM Collectives
=====================

* The ``fca`` scoll component: the Mellanox Fabric Collective
  Accelerator (FCA) is a solution for offloading collective operations
  from the MPI process onto Mellanox QDR InfiniBand switch CPUs and
  HCAs.

* The ``basic`` scoll component: Reference implementation of all
  OpenSHMEM collective operations.
