Open MPI |ompi_ver|
===================

`The Open MPI Project <https://www.open-mpi.org/>`_ is an open source
implementation of the `Message Passing Interface (MPI) specification
<https://www.mpi-forum.org/docs/>`_ that is developed and maintained
by a consortium of academic, research, and industry partners.  Open
MPI is therefore able to combine the expertise, technologies, and
resources from all across the High Performance Computing community in
order to build the best MPI library available.  Open MPI offers
advantages for system and software vendors, application developers and
computer science researchers.

The best way to hear about new Open MPI releases is via the
`low-volume announcement mailing list
<https://lists.open-mpi.org/mailman/listinfo/announce>`_.

Additionally, if you are a downstream packager of Open MPI (e.g., you
package Open MPI for an operating system distribution), you may wish
to sign up for the `low-volume packagers list
<https://lists.open-mpi.org/mailman/listinfo/ompi-packagers>`_.
