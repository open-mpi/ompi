.. This file is only used in certain cases.  Hence, the original file
   in the Open MPI "docs" source tree ends in ".txt", so that Sphinx
   will not complain if it is not used.  If it *is* used, it is copied
   to another file (that ends in ".rst") so that it can be properly
   found / used by Sphinx.

No content
^^^^^^^^^^

There is no meaningful content in this file because Open MPI was either:

* Built without PRRTE support.

* Built with a PRRTE that was too old to include machine-readable
  documentation that could be incorporated into Open MPI's
  documentation.

If you build Open MPI with a newer version of PRRTE (and have the
Sphinx tool available when you run Open MPI's ``configure`` command),
you should get more meaningful documentation here.

Hence, there is no documentation for this section.

Sorry!
