``make`` targets
================

Open MPI supports all the ``make`` targets that are provided by GNU
Automake, such as:

* ``all``: build the entire Open MPI package
* ``install``: install Open MPI
* ``uninstall``: remove all traces of Open MPI from the installation tree
* ``clean``: clean out the build tree

Once Open MPI has been built and installed, it is safe to run ``make
clean`` and/or remove the entire build tree.
