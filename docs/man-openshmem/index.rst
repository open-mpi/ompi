OpenSHMEM manual pages
======================

All of the content in this section is also installed as individual
manual ("man") pages in an OpenSHMEM installation.  If your man page
search path includes the location where OpenSHMEM installed its man
pages (which defaults to ``$prefix/share/man``), you can invoke
commands similar to the following to see the same content that you see
in these HTML pages:

.. code:: sh

   shell$ man shmem_init

OpenSHMEM man pages, by section:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   man1/index
   man3/index
