# This is the US/English general help file for Open RTE's orted.
#
[orted:usage]
Usage: %s [OPTION]...
Start an Open RTE Daemon

%s
[orted:environ]
Open RTE Daemon was unable to set
 %s = %s
in the environment. Returned value %d instead of ORTE_SUCCESS.
[orted:init-failure]
Open RTE was unable to initialize properly.  The error occured while
attempting to %s.  Returned value %d instead of ORTE_SUCCESS.

#
[orted:cannot-bind]
A request was made to bind the Open RTE daemons to
a core that does not exist on this node:

  node:  %s
  cores: %s

The MCA param directing this behavior is orte_daemon_cores.
Please correct the request and try again.
#
[cwd]
A dynamic operation (%s) was requested that requires us to obtain
the current working directory. Unfortunately, an error was returned
when we attempted to obtain it:

  error: %d

We are unable to complete the requested operation.
#
[bad-key]
A dynamic operation (%s) was requested that included an unrecognized
info key:

  group: %s
  key:   %s

The operation will continue, but may not behave completely as expected.
#
[timedout]
A request has timed out and will therefore fail:

  Operation:  %s

Your job may terminate as a result of this problem. You may want to
adjust the MCA parameter pmix_server_max_wait and try again. If this
occurred during a connect/accept operation, you can adjust that time
using the pmix_base_exchange_timeout parameter.
#
[noroom]
A request for an asynchronous runtime operation cannot be fulfilled
because of a lack of room in the tracking array:

  Operation:  %s
  Number of rooms:  %d

This is usually caused by a large job that encounters significant
delays across the cluster when starting the application processes.
Your job may terminate as a result of this problem. You may want to
adjust the MCA parameter pmix_server_max_reqs and try again.
#
[noserver]
A publish/lookup server was provided, but we were unable to connect
to it - please check the connection info and ensure the server
is alive:

  Connection:  %s
#
[mpir-debugger-detected]
Open MPI has detected that you have attached a debugger to this MPI
job, and that debugger is using the legacy "MPIR" method of
attachment.

Please note that Open MPI has deprecated the "MPIR" debugger
attachment method in favor of the new "PMIx" debugger attchment
mechanisms.

*** This means that future versions of Open MPI may not support the
*** "MPIR" debugger attachment method at all.  Specifically: the
*** debugger you just attached may not work with future versions of
*** Open MPI.

You may wish to contact your debugger vendor to inquire about support
for PMIx-based debugger attachment mechanisms. Meantime, you can
disable this warning by setting the OMPI_MPIR_DO_NOT_WARN envar to 1.
#
[both-file-and-dir-set]
Both the "output-directory" and "output-filename" options have been
set:

  Directory:      %s
  Filename:       %s

Only one of these can be set - please fix the options and try again.
