===========================================================================

This is where bindings of ORTE functions to alternative programming languages
such as Python and C++ reside. Not every ORTE function has been provided with
a wrapper - it is purely on an as-needed basis. However, there is no restriction
on the number of wrappers that can exist, nor on what type of function is wrapped.

There is only one rule to observe: you can wrap a framework, but you cannot wrap a
specific plugin within that framework. This constraint flows from the fact that
plugins are only accessed via the framework interface - thus, there is no way to
guarantee that a particular plugin will be the active selection.
