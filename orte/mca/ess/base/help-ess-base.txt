[ess-base:execv-error]
The singleton application was not able to find the executable "orted" in
your PATH or in the directory where Open MPI/OpenRTE was initially installed,
and therefore cannot continue.

For reference, we tried the following command:

  %s

and got the error %s.

This could mean that your PATH or executable name is wrong, or that you do not
have the necessary permissions.  Please ensure that the executable is able to be
found and executed as it is required for singleton operations.
