[static-and-dynamic]
Both static and dynamic port ranges were specified for the
out-of-band (OOB) communication subsystem:

Static ports:   %s
Dynamic ports:  %s

Only one can be specified. Please choose either static or
dynamic ports and try again.
#
[include-exclude]
Both TCP interface include and exclude lists were specified:

  Include: %s
  Exclude: %s

Only one of these can be given.
#
[not-parseable]
The specified network is not parseable. Since we cannot determine
your desired intent, we cannot establish a TCP socket for out-of-band
communications and will therefore abort. Please correct the network
specification and retry.
#
[no-included-found]
None of the networks specified to be included for out-of-band communications
could be found:

  Value given: %s

Please revise the specification and try again.
#
[excluded-all]
The specified list of networks to be excluded for out-of-band communications
resulted in no networks being available:

  Value given: %s

Please revise the specification and try again.
#
[no-interfaces-avail]
No network interfaces were found for out-of-band communications. We require
at least one available network for TCP-based messaging.
#
[invalid if_inexclude]
WARNING: An invalid value was given for oob_tcp_if_%s.  This
value will be ignored.

  Local host: %s
  Value:      %s
  Message:    %s
