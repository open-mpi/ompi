[static-and-dynamic]
Both static and dynamic port ranges were specified for the
out-of-band (OOB) communication subsystem:

Static ports:   %s
Dynamic ports:  %s

Only one can be specified. Please choose either static or
dynamic ports and try again.
#
[include-exclude]
Both TCP interface include and exclude lists were specified:

  Include: %s
  Exclude: %s

Only one of these can be given.
#
[not-parseable]
The specified network is not parseable. Since we cannot determine
your desired intent, we cannot establish a TCP socket for out-of-band
communications and will therefore abort. Please correct the network
specification and retry.
#
[no-included-found]
None of the TCP networks specified to be included for out-of-band communications
could be found:

  Value given: %s

Please revise the specification and try again.
#
[excluded-all]
The specified list of networks to be excluded for TCP out-of-band communications
resulted in no networks being available:

  Value given: %s

Please revise the specification and try again.
#
[invalid if_inexclude]
WARNING: An invalid value was given for oob_tcp_if_%s.  This
value will be ignored.

  Local host: %s
  Value:      %s
  Message:    %s
#
[authent-fail]
An attempt was made to make a TCP connection between two hosts:

  Initiating host:  %s
  Receiving host:   %s

Unfortunately, the connection was refused due to a failure to
authenticate. This is usually caused by a mis-match between
the security domains of the two hosts - e.g., one might be
using Munge while the other is not. This can typically be
resolved by specifying the desired security method. For
example, adding "--mca sec basic" to your command line.
