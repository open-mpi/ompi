/** @file:
 *
 * The Open RTE Resource MAPping Subsystem (RMAPS)
 * 
 * The resource mapping subsystem is responsible for mapping processes
 * to specific nodes/cpus within a given job. In many systems, this
 * functionality will not be supported - the system will map processes
 * wherever it chooses and does not allow the user to specify the
 * mapping. RMAPS components, therefore, provide services for those
 * systems that do permit such mappings.
 * 
 * RMAPS checks the MCA parameters to see if a mapping algorithm has
 * been specified.  If the user selected a mapping algorithm, the
 * indicated RMAPS component will take information from the registry
 * to determine the number of applications/processes to be run, and
 * the identified resources that have been allocated to this job. The
 * selected RMAP component will then assign processes to resources
 * according to its algorithm, with the results stored on the
 * appropriate job segment - the assigned nodename for each process is
 * stored in that respective process' container on the segment.
 *
