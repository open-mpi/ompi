[no-hwloc]
A slot_list containing detailed location info was given, but
hwloc support is not available:

  Rank:      %d
  Slot list:  %s

Unfortunately, hwloc support is required for this action.
Please reconfigure OMPI for hwloc if binding to specified
cpus is desired.
[no-rankfile]
Open RTE was unable to open the rankfile:
    %s
Check to make sure the path and filename are correct.

usage:  mpirun -mca rmaps_rankfile_path rankfile ./app

Examples of proper syntax include:
  cat hostfile
    host1
    host2
    host3
    host4
  cat rankfile
    rank 1=host1 slot=1:0,1
    rank 0=host2 slot=0:*
    rank 2=host4 slot=1-2
    rank 3=host3 slot=0:1;1:0-2
#
[parse_error_string]
Open RTE detected a parse error in the rankfile (%s)
It occured on line number %d on token %d:
    %s
Examples of proper syntax include:
    rank 1=host1 slot=1:0,1
    rank 0=host2 slot=0:*
    rank 2=host4 slot=1-2
    rank 3=host3 slot=0:1;1:0-2
#
[parse_error_int]
Open RTE detected a parse error in the rankfile (%s)
It occured on line number %d on token %d:
    %d
Examples of proper syntax include:
    rank 1=host1 slot=1:0,1
    rank 0=host2 slot=0:*
    rank 2=host4 slot=1-2
    rank 3=host3 slot=0:1;1:0-2
#
[parse_error]
Open RTE detected a parse error in the rankfile (%s)
It occured on line number %d on token %d. Examples of
proper syntax include:
    rank 1=host1 slot=1:0,1
    rank 0=host2 slot=0:*
    rank 2=host4 slot=1-2
    rank 3=host3 slot=0:1;1:0-2

#
[not-all-mapped-alloc]
Some of the requested ranks are not included in the current allocation.
    %s

Please verify that you have specified the allocated resources properly in
the provided rankfile.
#
[bad-host]
The rankfile that was used claimed that a host was either not
allocated or oversubscribed its slots.  Please review your rank-slot
assignments and your host allocation to ensure a proper match.  Also,
some systems may require using full hostnames, such as
"host1.example.com" (instead of just plain "host1").

  Host: %s
#
[bad-index]
Rankfile claimed host %s by index that is bigger than number of allocated hosts.
#
[orte-rmaps-rf:alloc-error]
There are not enough slots available in the system to satisfy the %d slots
that were requested by the application:
    %s

Either request fewer slots for your application, or make more slots available
for use.
#
[bad-rankfile]
Error, invalid rank (%d) in the rankfile (%s)
#
[bad-assign]
Error, rank %d is already assigned to %s, check %s
#
[bad-syntax]
Error, invalid syntax in the rankfile (%s)
syntax must be the fallowing
rank i=host_i slot=string
Examples of proper syntax include:
    rank 1=host1 slot=1:0,1
    rank 0=host2 slot=0:*
    rank 2=host4 slot=1-2
    rank 3=host3 slot=0:1;1:0-2
#
[orte-rmaps-rf:multi-apps-and-zero-np]
RMAPS found multiple applications to be launched, with
at least one that failed to specify the number of processes to execute.
When specifying multiple applications, you must specify how many processes
of each to launch via the -np argument.
#
[missing-rank]
A rank is missing its location specification:

  Rank:        %d
  Rank file:   %s

All processes must have their location specified in the rank file. Either
add an entry to the file, or provide a default slot_list to use for
any unspecified ranks.
