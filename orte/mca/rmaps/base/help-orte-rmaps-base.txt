[orte-rmaps-base:alloc-error]
There are not enough slots available in the system to satisfy the %d slots 
that were requested by the application:
  %s

Either request fewer slots for your application, or make more slots available
for use.
[orte-rmaps-base:not-all-mapped-alloc]
Some of the requested hosts are not included in the current allocation for the
application:
  %s
The requested hosts were:
  %s

Verify that you have mapped the allocated resources properly using the 
--host or --hostfile specification.
[orte-rmaps-base:no-mapped-node]
There are no allocated resources for the application 
  %s
that match the requested mapping:
  %s

Verify that you have mapped the allocated resources properly using the 
--host or --hostfile specification.
[orte-rmaps-base:nolocal-no-available-resources]
There are no available nodes allocated to this job. This could be because
no nodes were found or all the available nodes were already used.

Note that since the -nolocal option was given no processes can be 
launched on the local node.
[orte-rmaps-base:no-available-resources]
No nodes are available for this job, either due to a failure to
allocate nodes to the job, or allocated nodes being marked
as unavailable (e.g., down, rebooting, or a process attempting
to be relocated to another node when none are available).
[orte-rmaps-base:all-available-resources-used]
All nodes which are allocated for this job are already filled.
#
[out-of-vpids]
The system has exhausted its available ranks - the application is attempting
to spawn too many daemons and will be aborted.

This may be resolved by increasing the number of available ranks by
re-configuring with the --enable-jumbo-apps option, and then
re-building the application.
#
[rmaps:too-many-procs]
Your job has requested a conflicting number of processes for the
application:

App: %s
number of procs:  %d

This is more processes than we can launch under the following
additional directives and conditions:

%s:   %d
%s:   %d

Please revise the conflict and try again.
#
[too-many-cpus-per-rank]
Your job has requested more cpus per process(rank) than there
are cpus in a socket:

  Cpus/rank: %d
  #cpus/socket: %d

Please correct one or both of these values and try again.
#
[failed-map]
Your job failed to map. Either no mapper was available, or none
of the available mappers was able to perform the requested
mapping operation. This can happen if you request a map type
(e.g., loadbalance) and the corresponding mapper was not built.
#
[unrecognized-policy]
The specified %s policy is not recognized:

  Policy: %s

Please check for a typo or ensure that the option is a supported
one.
#
[redefining-policy]
Conflicting directives for %s policy are causing the policy
to be redefined:

  New policy:   %s
  Prior policy:  %s

Please check that only one policy is defined.
#
[rmaps:binding-target-not-found]
A request was made to bind to %s, but an appropriate target could not
be found on node %s.
#
[rmaps:binding-overload]
A request was made to bind to that would result in binding more
processes than cpus on a resource:

   Bind to:         %s
   Node:            %s
   #processes:  %d
   #cpus:          %d

You can override this protection by adding the "overload-allowed"
option to your binding directive.
#
[rmaps:no-topology]
A request was made for nperxxx that requires knowledge of
a remote node's topology. However, no topology info is
available for the following node:

  Node: %s

The job cannot be executed under this condition. Please either
remove the nperxxx directive and specify the number of processes
to use, or investigate the lack of topology info.
#
[rmaps:no-available-cpus]
While computing bindings, we found no available cpus on
the following node:

  Node:  %s

Please check your allocation.
#
[rmaps:cpubind-not-supported]
A request was made to bind a process, but at least one node does NOT
support binding processes to cpus.

  Node:  %s
#
[rmaps:membind-not-supported]
WARNING: a request was made to bind a process. While the system
supports binding the process itself, at least one node does NOT
support binding memory to the process location.

  Node:  %s

This is a warning only; your job will continue, though performance may
be degraded.
#
[rmaps:membind-not-supported-fatal]
A request was made to bind a process. While the system
supports binding the process itself, at least one node does NOT
support binding memory to the process location.

  Node:  %s

The provided memory binding policy requires that we abort the
job at this time.
#
[rmaps:no-bindable-objects]
No bindable objects of the specified type were available
on at least one node:

  Node:    %s
  Target:  %s
#
[rmaps:unknown-binding-level]
Unknown binding level:

  Target:  %s
  Cache level:  %u
