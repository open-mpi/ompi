[orte-rmaps-base:alloc-error]
There are not enough slots available in the system to satisfy the %d slots 
that were requested by the application:
  %s

Either request fewer slots for your application, or make more slots available
for use.
[orte-rmaps-base:not-all-mapped-alloc]
Some of the requested hosts are not included in the current allocation for the
application:
  %s
The requested hosts were:
  %s

Verify that you have mapped the allocated resources properly using the 
--host or --hostfile specification.
[orte-rmaps-base:no-mapped-node]
There are no allocated resources for the application: 
  %s
that match the requested mapping:
  %s: %s

Verify that you have mapped the allocated resources properly for the 
indicated specification.
[orte-rmaps-base:nolocal-no-available-resources]
There are no available nodes allocated to this job. This could be because
no nodes were found or all the available nodes were already used.

Note that since the -nolocal option was given no processes can be 
launched on the local node.
[orte-rmaps-base:no-available-resources]
No nodes are available for this job, either due to a failure to
allocate nodes to the job, or allocated nodes being marked
as unavailable (e.g., down, rebooting, or a process attempting
to be relocated to another node when none are available).
[orte-rmaps-base:all-available-resources-used]
All nodes which are allocated for this job are already filled.
#
[out-of-vpids]
The system has exhausted its available ranks - the application is attempting
to spawn too many daemons and will be aborted.

This may be resolved by increasing the number of available ranks by
re-configuring with the --enable-jumbo-apps option, and then
re-building the application.
#
[rmaps:too-many-procs]
Your job has requested a conflicting number of processes for the
application:

App: %s
number of procs:  %d

This is more processes than we can launch under the following
additional directives and conditions:

%s:   %d
%s:   %d

Please revise the conflict and try again.
#
[too-many-cpus-per-rank]
Your job has requested more cpus per process(rank) than there
are cpus in a socket:

  Cpus/rank: %d
  #cpus/socket: %d

Please correct one or both of these values and try again.
#
[failed-map]
Your job failed to map. Either no mapper was available, or none
of the available mappers was able to perform the requested
mapping operation. This can happen if you request a map type
(e.g., loadbalance) and the corresponding mapper was not built.
#
[unrecognized-policy]
The specified %s policy is not recognized:

  Policy: %s

Please check for a typo or ensure that the option is a supported
one.
#
[redefining-policy]
Conflicting directives for %s policy are causing the policy
to be redefined:

  New policy:   %s
  Prior policy:  %s

Please check that only one policy is defined.
#
[rmaps:binding-target-not-found]
A request was made to bind to %s, but an appropriate target could not
be found on node %s.
#
[rmaps:binding-overload]
A request was made to bind to that would result in binding more
processes than cpus on a resource:

   Bind to:     %s
   Node:        %s
   #processes:  %d
   #cpus:       %d

You can override this protection by adding the "overload-allowed"
option to your binding directive.
#
[rmaps:no-topology]
A mapping directive was given that requires knowledge of
a remote node's topology. However, no topology info is
available for the following node:

  Node: %s

The job cannot be executed under this condition. Please either
remove the directive or investigate the lack of topology info.
#
[rmaps:no-available-cpus]
While computing bindings, we found no available cpus on
the following node:

  Node:  %s

Please check your allocation.
#
[rmaps:cpubind-not-supported]
A request was made to bind a process, but at least one node does NOT
support binding processes to cpus.

  Node:  %s
This usually is due to not having libnumactl and libnumactl-devel
installed on the node.
#
[rmaps:membind-not-supported]
WARNING: a request was made to bind a process. While the system
supports binding the process itself, at least one node does NOT
support binding memory to the process location.

  Node:  %s

This usually is due to not having the required NUMA support installed
on the node. In some Linux distributions, the required support is
contained in the libnumactl and libnumactl-devel packages.
This is a warning only; your job will continue, though performance may be degraded.
#
[rmaps:membind-not-supported-fatal]
A request was made to bind a process. While the system
supports binding the process itself, at least one node does NOT
support binding memory to the process location.

  Node:  %s

This usually is due to not having the required NUMA support installed
on the node. In some Linux distributions, the required support is
contained in the libnumactl and libnumactl-devel packages.
The provided memory binding policy requires that we abort the job at this time.
#
[rmaps:no-bindable-objects]
No bindable objects of the specified type were available
on at least one node:

  Node:    %s
  Target:  %s
#
[rmaps:unknown-binding-level]
Unknown binding level:

  Target:  %s
  Cache level:  %u
#
[orte-rmaps-base:missing-daemon]
While attempting to build a map of this job, a node
was detected to be missing a daemon:

  Node:  %s

This usually indicates a mismatch between what the
allocation provided for the node name versus what was
actually found on the node.
#
[orte-rmaps-base:no-objects]
No objects of the specified type were found on at least one node:

  Type: %s
  Node: %s

The map cannot be done as specified.
#
[topo-file]
A topology file was given for the compute nodes, but
we were unable to correctly process it. Common errors
include incorrectly specifying the path to the file,
or the file being generated in a way that is incompatible
with the version of hwloc being used by OMPI.

  File: %s

Please correct the problem and try again.
#
[deprecated]
The following command line options and corresponding MCA parameter have
been deprecated and replaced as follows:

  Command line options:
    Deprecated:  %s
    Replacement: %s

  Equivalent MCA parameter:
    Deprecated:  %s
    Replacement: %s

The deprecated forms *will* disappear in a future version of Open MPI.
Please update to the new syntax.
#
[mismatch-binding]
A request for multiple cpus-per-proc was given, but a conflicting binding
policy was specified:

  #cpus-per-proc:  %d
  type of cpus:    %s
  binding policy given: %s

The correct binding policy for the given type of cpu is:

  correct binding policy:  %s

This is the binding policy we would apply by default for this
situation, so no binding need be specified. Please correct the
situation and try again.
#
[mapping-too-low]
A request for multiple cpus-per-proc was given, but a directive
was also give to map to an object level that has less cpus than
requested ones:

  #cpus-per-proc:  %d
  number of cpus:  %d
  map-by:          %s

Please specify a mapping level that has more cpus, or else let us
define a default mapping that will allow multiple cpus-per-proc.
#
[unrecognized-modifier]
The mapping request contains an unrecognized modifier:

  Request: %s

Please check your request and try again.
#
[invalid-pattern]
The mapping request contains a pattern that doesn't match
the required syntax of #:object

  Pattern: %s

Please check your request and try again.
#
[orte-rmaps-base:oversubscribed]
The requested number of processes exceeds the allocated
number of slots:

  #slots:       %d
  #processes:   %d

This creates an oversubscribed condition that may adversely
impact performance when combined with the requested binding
operation. We will continue, but will not bind the processes.
This warning can be omitted by adding the "overload-allowed"
qualifier to the binding policy.
#
[cannot-launch]
Although we were able to map your job, we are unable to launch
it at this time due to required resources being busy. Please
try again later.
#
[rmaps:no-locale]
The request to bind processes could not be completed due to
an internal error - the locale of the following process was
not set by the mapper code:

  Process:  %s

Please contact the OMPI developers for assistance. Meantime,
you will still be able to run your application without binding
by specifying "--bind-to none" on your command line.
#
[mapping-too-low-init]
A request for multiple cpus-per-proc was given, but a directive
was also give to map to an object level that cannot support that
directive.

Please specify a mapping level that has more than one cpu, or
else let us define a default mapping that will allow multiple
cpus-per-proc.
#
[unrecog-modifier]
A modifier was given to the --map-by directive that is not
recognized:

  Modifier:  %s

Please see "mpirun --help" for a description of supported
modifiers.
