# Note that this file must exist, even though it is empty (there is no
# "base" directory for the common framework).  autogen.pl and
# opal_mca.m4 assume that every framework has a top-level Makefile.am.
# We *could* adjust the framework glue code to exclude "common" from
# this requirement, but it's just a lot easier to have an empty
# Makefile.am here.
