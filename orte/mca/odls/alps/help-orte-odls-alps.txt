[execve error]
Open MPI tried to fork a new process via the "execve" system call but
failed.  Open MPI checks many things before attempting to launch a
child process, but nothing is perfect. This error may be indicative
of another problem on the target host, or even something as silly as
having specified a directory for your application. Your job will now
abort.

#
[binding not supported]
Open MPI tried to bind a new process, but process binding is not
supported on the host where it was launched.  The process was killed
without launching the target application.  Your job will now abort.

  Local host:        %s
  Application name:  %s
#
[binding generic error]
Open MPI tried to bind a new process, but something went wrong.  The
process was killed without launching the target application.  Your job
will now abort.

  Location:          %s:%d
#
[bound to everything]
Open MPI tried to bind a new process to a specific set of processors,
but ended up binding it to *all* processors.  This means that the new
process is effectively unbound.

This is only a warning -- your job will continue.  You can suppress
this warning in the future by setting the odls_warn_if_not_bound MCA
parameter to 0.

#
[slot list and paffinity_alone]
Open MPI detected that both a slot list was specified and the MCA
parameter "paffinity_alone" was set to true.  Only one of these can be
used at a time.  Your job will now abort.

[iof setup failed]
Open MPI tried to launch a child process but the "IOF child setup"
failed.  This should not happen.  Your job will now abort.
