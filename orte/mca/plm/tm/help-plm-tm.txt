[tm-bad-launchid]
The TM (PBS / Torque) process starter cannot spawn the specified
application on a remote node due to an invalid launch_id.

This is most likely due to use of the "--hostfile" option to the
command line with one or more hosts in that file not having
been allocated to this job.

Removing "--hostfile" from the command line will likely allow the
application to be launched.
#
[multiple-prefixes]
Multiple different --prefix options were specified to mpirun for the
same node.  This is a fatal error for the TM (PBS / Torque) process
starter in Open MPI.

The first two prefix values supplied for node %s were:
    %s
and %s
#
[tm-spawn-failed]
The TM (PBS / Torque) process starter failed to spawn a daemon (orted)
on a remote node.

Command line: %s
Node name: %s
Launch id: %d

If you do not understand this error mesage, please try the following:

1. Ensure that the executable "orted" is in your PATH
2. Use the --prefix option to indicate where we can
   find that executable
3. Talk to your local system administrator
#
[no-local-slave-support]
A call was made to launch a local slave process, but no support
is available for doing so. Launching a local slave requires support
for either rsh or ssh on the backend nodes where MPI processes
are running.

Please consult with your system administrator about obtaining
such support.
