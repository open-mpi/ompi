[no-nodes-found]
No nodes were found in the PBS_NODEFILE:

%s

This is probably a setup issue, could be due to a corrupted file, or
- most probably - is caused by having failed to obtain an allocation.
#
[smp-error]
The SMP mode flag was given, but the required PBS_PPN environmental
variable was not found. Please check that your system actually supports
the indicated mode and try again.
#
[smp-multi]
The SMP mode flag was given, but a node was listed in the PBS_Nodefile
more than once. This usually indicates that the system is not
actually operating in SMP mode. Please check your system configuration
and try again.
