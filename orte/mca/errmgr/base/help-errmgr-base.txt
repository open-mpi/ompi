[undeliverable-msg]
An attempt was made to send a message to a process whose
address is unknown:

  Sender:     %s
  From node:  %s
  Recipient:  %s
  On node:    %s

The message could not be delivered, and we are aborting.
#
[failed-daemon-launch]
ORTE was unable to reliably start one or more daemons.
This usually is caused by:

* not finding the required libraries and/or binaries on
  one or more nodes. Please check your PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  settings, or configure OMPI with --enable-orterun-prefix-by-default

* lack of authority to execute on one or more specified nodes.
  Please verify your allocation and authorities.

* the inability to write startup files into /tmp (--tmpdir/orte_tmpdir_base).
  Please check with your sys admin to determine the correct location to use.

*  compilation of the orted with dynamic libraries when static are required
  (e.g., on Cray). Please check your configure cmd line and consider using
  one of the contrib/platform definitions for your system type.

* an inability to create a connection back to mpirun due to a
  lack of common network interfaces and/or no route found between
  them. Please check network connectivity (including firewalls
  and network routing requirements).
#
[failed-daemon]
An ORTE daemon has unexpectedly failed after launch and before
communicating back to mpirun. This could be caused by a number
of factors, including an inability to create a connection back
to mpirun due to a lack of common network interfaces and/or no
route found between them. Please check network connectivity
(including firewalls and network routing requirements).
#
[node-died]
ORTE has lost communication with a remote daemon.

  HNP daemon   : %s on node %s
  Remote daemon: %s on node %s

This is usually due to either a failure of the TCP network
connection to the node, or possibly an internal failure of
the daemon itself. We cannot recover from this failure, and
therefore will terminate the job.
#
[no-path]
ORTE does not know how to route a message to the specified daemon
located on the indicated node:

  my node:   %s
  target node:  %s

This is usually an internal programming error that should be
reported to the developers. In the meantime, a workaround may
be to set the MCA param routed=direct on the command line or
in your environment. We apologize for the problem.
#
[no-connect]
ORTE is unable to establish a communication connection to the
specified daemon located on the indicated node:

  my node:   %s
  target node:  %s

This is usually due to a lack of common network interfaces and/or
no route found between them. Please check network connectivity (including
firewalls and network routing requirements). If these look okay,
then it could be an internal programming error that should be
reported to the developers. In the meantime, a workaround may
be to set the MCA param routed=direct on the command line or
in your environment.
#
[simple-message]
An internal error has occurred in ORTE:

%s

This is something that should be reported to the developers.
