[orterun:init-failure]
Open RTE was unable to initialize properly.  The error occured while
attempting to %s.  Returned value %d instead of ORTE_SUCCESS.
[orterun:usage]
%s (%s) %s

Usage: %s [OPTION]...  [PROGRAM]...
Start the given program using Open RTE

%s

Report bugs to %s
[orterun:version]
%s (%s) %s

Report bugs to %s
[orterun:allocate-resources]
%s was unable to allocate enough resources to start your application.
This might be a transient error (too many nodes in the cluster were
unavailable at the time of the request) or a permenant error (you
requsted more nodes than exist in your cluster).

While probably only useful to Open RTE developers, the error returned
was %d.
[orterun:error-spawning]
%s was unable to start the specified application.  An attempt has been
made to clean up all processes that did start.  The error returned was
%d.
[orterun:appfile-not-found]
Unable to open the appfile:

    %s

Double check that this file exists and is readable.
[orterun:executable-not-specified]
No executable was specified on the %s command line.

Aborting.
[orterun:multi-apps-and-zero-np]
%s found multiple applications specified on the command line, with
at least one that failed to specify the number of processes to execute.
When specifying multiple applications, you must specify how many processes
of each to launch via the -np argument.
[orterun:nothing-to-do]
%s could not find anything to do.

It is possible that you forgot to specify how many processes to run
via the "-np" argument.
[orterun:call-failed]
%s encountered a %s call failure.  This should not happen, and
usually indicates an error within the operating system itself.
Specifically, the following error occurred:

    %s

The only other available information that may be helpful is the errno
that was returned: %d.
[orterun:environ]
%s was unable to set
 %s = %s
in the environment. Returned value %d instead of ORTE_SUCCESS.
[orterun:precondition]
%s was unable to precondition transports
Returned value %d instead of ORTE_SUCCESS.
[orterun:attr-failed]
%s was unable to define an attribute
Returned value %d instead of ORTE_SUCCESS.
[orterun:proc-aborted]
%s noticed that job rank %lu with PID %lu on node %s exited on signal %d.
[orterun:proc-aborted-strsignal]
%s noticed that job rank %lu with PID %lu on node %s exited on signal %d (%s). 
[orterun:abnormal-exit]
WARNING: %s has exited before it received notification that all
started processes had terminated.  You should double check and ensure
that there are no runaway processes still executing.
#
[orterun:sigint-while-processing]
WARNING: %s is in the process of killing a job, but has detected an
interruption (probably control-C).

It is dangerous to interrupt %s while it is killing a job (proper
termination may not be guaranteed).  Hit control-C again within 1
second if you really want to kill %s immediately.
#
[orterun:empty-prefix]
A prefix was supplied to %s that only contained slashes.  

This is a fatal error; %s will now abort.  No processes were launched.
#
[debugger-mca-param-not-found]
Internal error -- the orte_base_debugger MCA parameter was not able to
be found.  Please contact the Open RTE developers; this should not
happen.
#
[debugger-orte_base_user_debugger-empty]
The MCA parameter "orte_base_user_debugger" was empty, indicating that
no user-level debuggers have been defined.  Please set this MCA
parameter to a value and try again.
#
[debugger-not-found]
A suitable debugger could not be found in your PATH.  Check the values
specified in the orte_base_user_debugger MCA parameter for the list of
debuggers that was searched.
#
[debugger-exec-failed]
%s was unable to launch the specified debugger.  This is what was
launched:

    %s

Things to check:

    - Ensure that the debugger is installed properly
    - Ensure that the "%s" executable is in your path
    - Ensure that any required licenses are available to run the debugger
#
[orterun:daemon-die]
%s was unable to cleanly terminate the daemons for this job. Returned value %s instead of ORTE_SUCCESS.
