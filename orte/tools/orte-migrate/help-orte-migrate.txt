[invalid_pid]
Error: The PID (%d) is invalid because either you have not provided a PID
       or provided an invalid PID.
       Please see --help for usage.
#
[no_universe]
Error: Unable to find the contact information for PID %d.
       This could be due to one of the following:
        - The PID is not that of an active MPIRUN.
        - The application with this PID isn't migratable
        - The application with this PID isn't an Open MPI application.

#
[unable_to_connect]
Error: Unable to connect to the Head Node Process to initiate the
       migration of the application.
       This could be due to one of the following:
        - The PID is not that of an active MPIRUN.
        - The application with this PID isn't migratable
        - The application with this PID isn't an Open MPI application.
#
[non-ckptable]
Error: The job with pid %d is not checkpointable.
       This could be caused by one of the following:
        - The application is using unsupported components.
        - Your application did not select to be checkpointable
To enable checkpointing in an application use the following AMCA parameter
argument to mpirun:
       -am ft-enable-cr

#
[err-other]
Error: The Job identified by PID (%d) was not able to migrate processes in this
       job. This could be caused by any of the following:
       - Invalid node or rank specified
       - No processes on the indicated node can by migrated
       - Process migration was not enabled for this job. Make sure to indicate
         the proper AMCA file: "-am ft-enable-cr-recovery".
