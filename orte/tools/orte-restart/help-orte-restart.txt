[invalid_filename]
Error: The filename provided (referenced below) could not be used for
       restarting the job. This could be for a variety of reasons:
       - The filename/handle is invalid,
       - The snapshot directory no longer exisits, or
       - There are no stable checkpoint sequences in this global snapshot.
       Please see --help for usage.

Filename: %s
#
[restart_cmd_failure]
Error: Unable to obtain the proper restart command to restart from the 
       checkpoint file (%s). Returned %d.
#
[comp_select_failure]
Error: Unable to select the %s component needed to restart this
       application. (Returned %d)
       This likely indicates that the checkpointer needed is not 
       available on this machine. You should move to a machine that
       has this checkpointer enabled.
#
[restart_failure]
Error: The restart command:
          shell$ %s
       returned an error code %d, and was unable to restart properly.
#
[invalid_seq_num]
Error: The filename (%s) and sequence number (%d) could not be used.
       This may be caused by an invalid sequence number. Try using the
       '-i' option to determine a correct value.
#
[amca_param_not_found]
Warning: Unable to find the AMCA parameter in the checkpoint metadata.
         This is the option supplied to mpirun as '-am '. Restart will
         assume this value to be '%s'.
#
[tune_param_not_found]
Warning: Unable to find the TUNE parameter in the checkpoint metadata.
         This is the option supplied to mpirun as '-tune '. Restart will
         assume this value to be '%s'.
