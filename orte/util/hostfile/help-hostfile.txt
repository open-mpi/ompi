[no-hostfile]
Open RTE was unable to open the hostfile:
    %s
Check to make sure the path and filename are correct.
[port]
Open RTE detected a bad parameter in the hostfile:
    %s
The port parameter is less than 0:
    port=%d
[slots]
Open RTE detected a bad parameter in the hostfile:
    %s
The slots parameter is less than 0:
    slots=%d
[max_slots]
Open RTE detected a bad parameter in the hostfile:
    %s
The max_slots parameter is less than 0:
    max_slots=%d
[max_slots_lt]
Open RTE detected a bad parameter in the hostfile:
    %s
The max_slots parameter is less than the slots parameter:
    slots=%d
    max_slots=%d
[parse_error_string]
Open RTE detected a parse error in the hostfile:
    %s
It occured on line number %d on token %d:
    %s
[parse_error_int]
Open RTE detected a parse error in the hostfile:
    %s
It occured on line number %d on token %d:
    %d
[parse_error]
Open RTE detected a parse error in the hostfile:
    %s
It occured on line number %d on token %d.
[not-all-mapped-alloc]
Some of the requested hosts are not included in the current allocation.

The requested hosts were in this hostfile:
  %s

Please verify that you have specified the allocated resources properly in
the provided hostfile.
#
[hostfile:relative-syntax]
A relative host was specified, but no prior allocation has been made.
Thus, there is no way to determine the proper host to be used.

hostfile entry: %s

Please see the orte_hosts man page for further information.
#
[hostfile:relative-node-not-found]
A relative host was specified, but was not found. The requested host was
specified as:

Index: %d
Syntax given: %s

This is most likely due to the relative index being out of bounds. You
could obtain a larger allocation or reduce the relative host index.
Please see the orte_hosts man page for further information.
#
[hostfile:invalid-relative-node-syntax]
A relative host was improperly specified - the value provided was.

hostfile entry: %s

You may have forgotten to preface a node with 'N' or 'n', or used the 'e' or 'E' to indicate
empty nodes. Please see the orte_hosts man page for further information.
#
[hostfile:not-enough-empty]
The requested number of empty hosts was not available - the system was short by %d hosts.

Please recheck your allocation - further information is available on the
orte_hosts man page.
[boards]
Open RTE detected a bad parameter in the hostfile:
    %s
The boards parameter is less than 0:
    boards=%d
[sockets]
Open RTE detected a bad parameter in the hostfile:
    %s
The sockets parameter is less than 0:
    sockets=%d
[cores]
Open RTE detected a bad parameter in the hostfile:
    %s
The cores parameter is less than 0:
    cores=%d

#
[hostfile:extra-node-not-found]
A hostfile was provided that contains at least one node not
present in the allocation:

  hostfile:  %s
  node:      %s

If you are operating in a resource-managed environment, then only
nodes that are in the allocation can be used in the hostfile. You
may find relative node syntax to be a useful alternative to
specifying absolute node names see the orte_hosts man page for
further information.
#
[slots-given]
A hostfile was provided that contains multiple definitions
of the slot count for at least one node:

  hostfile:  %s
  node:      %s

You can either list a node multiple times, once for each slot,
or you can provide a single line that contains "slot=N". Mixing
the two methods is not supported.

Please correct the hostfile and try again.
