# This is the VERSION file for Open MPI, describing the precise
# version of Open MPI in this distribution.  The various components of
# the version number below are combined to form a single version
# number string.

# major, minor, and release are generally combined in the form
# <major>.<minor>.<release>.

major=3
minor=0
release=0

# greek is generally used for alpha or beta release tags.  If it is
# non-empty, it will be appended to the version number.  It does not
# have to be numeric.  Common examples include: a1 (alpha release 1),
# b1 (beta release 1), rc2 (release candidate 2).  The only
# requirement is that it must be entirely printable ASCII characters
# and have no white space.

greek=a1

# If repo_rev is empty, then the repository version number will be
# obtained during "make dist" via the "git describe --tags --always"
# command, or with the date (if "git describe" fails) in the form of
# "date<date>".

repo_rev=

# If tarball_version is not empty, it is used as the version string in
# the tarball filename, regardless of all other versions listed in
# this file.  For example, if tarball_version is empty, the tarball
# filename will be of the form
# openmpi-<major>.<minor>.<release><greek>.tar.*.  However, if
# tarball_version is not empty, the tarball filename will be of the
# form openmpi-<tarball_version>.tar.*.

tarball_version=gitclone

# The date when this release was created

date="Unreleased developer copy"

# The shared library version of each of Open MPI's public libraries.
# These versions are maintained in accordance with the "Library
# Interface Versions" chapter from the GNU Libtool documentation.  The
# first Open MPI release to programatically specify these versions was
# v1.3.4 (note that Libtool defaulted all prior releases to 0:0:0).
# All changes in these version numbers are dictated by the Open MPI
# release managers (not individual developers).  Notes:

# 1. Since these version numbers are associated with *releases*, the
# version numbers maintained on the Open MPI SVN trunk (and developer
# branches) is always 0:0:0 for all libraries.

# 2. The version number of libmpi refers to the public MPI interfaces.
# It does not refer to any internal interfaces.

# 3. Similar to libmpi, the version numbers of the Fortran libraries
# refer to the public MPI interfaces.  For example, that there have
# been typo fixes in the parameter types to mpif.h Fortran library
# functions over time; these technically did not change the interface
# because Fortran 77 does not link by parameter type.

# 4. Similar to libmpi, libmpi_cxx's version number refers to the
# public MPI interfaces.  Note that this version number may or may not
# be affected by changes to inlined functions in OMPI's
# header-file-based C++ bindings implementation.

# 5. The ORTE and OPAL libraries will change versions when their
# public interfaces change (as relative to the layer(s) above them).
# None of the ORTE and OPAL interfaces are public to MPI applications,
# but they are "public" within the OMPI code base and select 3rd party
# software packages.

# Version numbers are described in the Libtool current:revision:age
# format.
