# This is the VERSION file for Open MPI, describing the precise
# version of Open MPI in this distribution.  The various components of
# the version number below are combined to form a single version
# number string.

# major, minor, and release are generally combined in the form
# <major>.<minor>.<release>.  If release is zero, then it is omitted.

major=1
minor=4
release=5

# greek is used for alpha or beta release tags.  If it is non-empty,
# it will be appended to the version number.  It does not have to be
# numeric.  Common examples include a1 (alpha release 1),
# b1 (beta release 1), sc2005 (Super Computing 2005 release).  The
# only requirement is that it must be entirely printable ASCII 
# characters and have no white space.

greek=rc7

# If want_svn=1, then the SVN r number will be included in the overall
# Open MPI version number in some form.

want_svn=1

# If svn_r=-1, then the SVN r number will be obtained dynamically at
# run time, either 1) via the "svnversion" command (if this is a
# Subversion checkout) in the form "r<svn_r>", or b) with the date (if
# this is not a Subversion checkout, and the svnversion command cannot
# be used) in the form of "svn<date>".  Alternatively, if svn_r is not
# -1, the value of svn_r will be directly appended to the version
# string.  This happens during "make dist", for example: if the
# distribution tarball is being made from an SVN checkout, the value
# of svn_r in this file is replaced with the output of "svnversion".

svn_r=-1

# The date when this release was created

date="Unreleased"

# The shared library version of each of Open MPI's public libraries.
# These versions are maintained in accordance with the "Library
# Interface Versions" chapter from the GNU Libtool documentation.  The
# first Open MPI release to programatically specify these versions was
# v1.3.4 (note that Libtool defaulted all prior releases to 0:0:0).
# All changes in these version numbers are dictated by the Open MPI
# release managers (not individual developers).  Notes:

# 1. Since these version numbers are associated with *releases*, the
# version numbers maintained on the Open MPI SVN trunk (and developer
# branches) is always 0:0:0 for all libraries.

# 2. The version number of libmpi refers to the public MPI interfaces.
# It does not refer to any internal interfaces.

# 3. Similar to libmpi, libmpi_f77, libmpi_f90 (and possibly other
# Fortran libraries someday -- shrudder!), the version number refers
# to the public MPI interfaces.  Note that there have been typo fixes
# in the parameter types to libmpi_f77 functions over time; these
# technically did not change the interface because Fortran 77 does not
# link by parameter type.

# 4. Similar to libmpi, libmpi_cxx's version number refers to the
# public MPI interfaces.  Note that this version number may or may not
# be affected by changes to inlined functions in OMPI's
# header-file-based C++ bindings implementation.

# 5. For the v1.4 series, we have decided not to change the version
# numbers for libopen-rte.so and libopen-pal.so because of deep voodo
# linker reasons. This policy is only in effect for the v1.4 series;
# the v1.5 series will update libopen-rte.so/libopen-pal.so version
# numbers as appropriate. This policy change will unfortunately cause
# an ABI breakage for MPI applications between the v1.4 and v1.5
# series -- sorry folks! :-(

# Version numbers are described in the Libtool current:revision:age
# format.

# NOTE: 

# In 1.4.4, we bumped the libmpi_f90_so_version and
# libmca_common_sm_so_version numbers such that they now conflict with
# Open MPI v1.5 release numbers.  This was seen as a lesser of evils;
# we preserved ABI for the f90 library, but at the expense of a
# conflicting .so library version number.  This is not *quite* as evil
# as it sounds, however, as you cannot have 2 Open MPI installs in the
# same directory tree (due to conflicts of other files, such as
# mpi.h).  Hence, you can't have a v1.4.x and v1.5.x in the same tree
# *anyway* -- so the fact that v1.4.x might have the same filename for
# the F90 MPI bindings library as v1.5.x is not entirely evil.
# Meaning: philosophically, it's a bad idea.  But in practice, it
# won't create any problems.

# "Common" components install standalone libraries that are run-time
# linked by one or more components.  So they need to be versioned as
# well.  Yuck; this somewhat breaks the
# components-don't-affect-the-build-system abstraction.
