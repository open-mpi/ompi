Overview
========

This file is here for those who are building/exploring OMPI in its
source code form, most likely through a developer's tree (i.e., a
Subversion or Mercurial checkout).


Debugging vs. Optimized Builds
==============================

If you are building Open MPI from a Subversion checkout, the default
build includes a lot of debugging features.  This happens
automatically when when configure detects the hidden ".svn" Subversion
meta directory (that is present in all Subversion checkouts) in your
source tree, and therefore activates a number of developer-only
debugging features in the Open MPI code base.  

The same debugging features are activated if you build in a Mercurial
clone (with the hidden ".hg" meta directory).

By definition, debugging builds will perform [much] slower than
optimized builds of Open MPI.  You should *NOT* conduct timing tests
or try to run production performance numbers with debugging builds.

If you wish to build an optimized version of Open MPI from a
developer's checkout, you have three main options:

1. Use the "--with-platform=optimized" switch to configure.  This is
   the preferred (and probably easiest) method.  For example:

     shell$ svn co http://svn.open-mpi.org/svn/ompi/trunk ompi
     shell$ cd ompi
     shell$ ./autogen.pl
     shell$ mkdir build
     shell$ cd build
     shell$ ./configure --with-platform=optimized ...
     [...lots of output...]
     shell$ make all install

2. Use a VPATH build.  Simply build Open MPI from a different
   directory than the source tree -- one where the .svn / .hg
   subdirectory is not present.  For example:

     shell$ svn co http://svn.open-mpi.org/svn/ompi/trunk ompi
     shell$ cd ompi
     shell$ ./autogen.p
     shell$ mkdir build
     shell$ cd build
     shell$ ../configure ...
     [...lots of output...]
     shell$ make all install

3. Manually specify configure options to disable all the debugging
   options (note that this is exactly what "--with-platform=optimized"
   does behind the scenes).  You'll need to carefully examine the
   output of "./configure --help" to see which options to disable.
   They are all listed, but some are less obvious than others (they
   are not listed here because it is a changing set of flags; by
   Murphy's Law, listing them here will pretty much guarantee that
   this file will get out of date):

     shell$ ./configure --disable-debug ...
     [...lots of output...]
     shell$ make all install


Use of GNU m4, Autoconf, Automake, and Libtool
==============================================

This procedure is *ONLY* necessary if you are building from a
developer's tree.  If you have an Open MPI distribution tarball, this
procedure is unnecessary -- you can (and should) skip reading this
section.

If you are building Open MPI from a developer's tree, you must first
install fairly recent versions of the GNU tools m4, Autoconf, Automake,
and Libtool.  The specific versions required depend on if you are
using the trunk or a release branch (and which release branch you are
using).  The specific versions can be found at:

  http://www.open-mpi.org/svn/building.php

You can check what versions of the autotools you have installed with
the following:

shell$ m4 --version
shell$ autoconf --version
shell$ automake --version
shell$ libtoolize --version

To strengthen the above point: the core Open MPI developers typically
use very, very recent versions of the GNU tools.  There are known bugs
in older versions of the GNU tools that Open MPI no longer compensates
for (it seemed senseless to indefinitely support patches for ancient
versions of Autoconf, for example).  You *WILL* have problems if you
do not use recent versions of the GNU tools.

If you need newer versions, you are *strongly* encouraged to heed the
following advice:

NOTE: On MacOS/X, the default "libtool" program is different than the
      GNU libtool.  You must download and install the GNU version (via
      Fink or any other mechanism).

1. Unless your OS distribution has easy-to-use binary installations,
   the sources can be can be downloaded from:

        ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/m4/
        ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/autoconf/
        ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/automake/
        ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/libtool/

2. Build and install the tools in the following order:

   2a. m4
   2b. Autoconf
   2c. Automake
   2d. Libtool

3. You MUST install all four tools into the same prefix directory.
   These four tools are somewhat inter-related, and if they're going
   to be used together, they MUST share a common installation prefix.

   3a. It is *strongly* encouraged that you do not install your new
       versions over the OS-installed versions.  This could cause
       other things on your system to break.  Instead, install into
       $HOME/local, or /usr/local, or wherever else you tend to
       install "local" kinds of software.
   3b. In doing so, be sure to prefix your $path with the directory
       where they are installed.  For example, if you install into
       $HOME/local, you may want to edit your shell startup file
       (.bashrc, .cshrc, .tcshrc, etc.) to have something like:

          # For bash/sh:
          export PATH=$HOME/local/bin:$PATH
          # For csh/tcsh:
          set path = ($HOME/local/bin $path)

   3c. Ensure to set your $path *BEFORE* you configure/build/install
       the four packages.

4. All four packages require two simple commands to build and
   install (where PREFIX is the prefix discussed in 3, above).

      shell$ cd m4-1.4.13
      shell$ ./configure --prefix=PREFIX
      shell$ make; make install

      --> NOTE: The builds are so short that parallel builds really
          aren't worth it (and cause problems in some cases).

      --> If you are using the csh or tcsh shells, be sure to run the
          "rehash" command after you install each package.

      shell$ cd ../autoconf-2.65
      shell$ ./configure --prefix=PREFIX
      shell$ make; make install

      --> If you are using the csh or tcsh shells, be sure to run the
          "rehash" command after you install each package.

      shell$ cd ../automake-1.11.1
      shell$ ./configure --prefix=PREFIX
      shell$ make; make install

      --> If you are using the csh or tcsh shells, be sure to run the
          "rehash" command after you install each package.

      shell$ cd ../libtool-2.2.6
      shell$ ./configure --prefix=PREFIX
      shell$ make; make install

      --> If you are using the csh or tcsh shells, be sure to run the
          "rehash" command after you install each package.

   m4, Autoconf and Automake build and install very quickly; Libtool will
   take a minute or two.

5. You can now run OMPI's top-level "autogen.pl" script.  This script
   will invoke the GNU Autoconf, Automake, and Libtool commands in the
   proper order and setup to run OMPI's top-level "configure" script.

   Running autogen.pl may take several minutes, depending on your
   system.  It's not very exciting to watch.  :-)

   If you have a multi-processor system, enabling the multi-threaded
   behavior in Automake 1.11 (or newer) can result in autogen.pl
   running faster.  Do this by setting the AUTOMAKE_JOBS environment
   variable to the number of processors (threads) that you want it to
   use.  For example (you can again put this in your shell startup
   files):

       # For bash/sh:
       export AUTOMAKE_JOBS=4
       # For csh/tcsh:
       set AUTOMAKE_JOBS 4

   5a. You generally need to run autogen.pl whenever the top-level
       file "configure.ac" changes, or any files in the config/
       directory change (the config/ directory is where a lot of
       "include" files for OMPI's configure script live).

   5b. You do *NOT* need to re-run autogen.pl if you modify a
       Makefile.am.

Use of Flex
===========

Flex is used during the compilation of a developer's checkout (it is
not used in distribution tarballs).  Other flavors of lex are *not*
supported: given the choice of making parsing code portable between
all flavors of lex and doing more interesting work on Open MPI, we
greatly prefer the latter.  

Several POSIXly-oriented developers use the stable flex version
v2.5.4a from July of 1997.  Others have upgraded to more recent
versions; these also seem to work fine.  Note that no testing has been
performed to see what the minimum version of Flex is required by Open
MPI.  We suggest that you use v2.5.4a at the earliest.

*** NOTE: Windows builds of Open MPI require Flex version 2.5.35.
Specifically, we know that v2.5.35 works and 2.5.4a does not.  We have
not tested to figure out exactly what the minimum required flex
version is on Windows; we suggest that you use 2.5.35 at the earliest.
It is for this reason that the contrib/dist/make_dist_tarball script
checks for a Windows-friendly version of flex before continuing.

Note that the flex-generated code generates some compiler warnings on
some platforms, but the warnings do not seem to be consistent or
uniform on all platforms, compilers, and flex versions.  As such, we
have done little to try to remove those warnings.

following URL:
